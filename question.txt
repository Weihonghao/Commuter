This your revenge ? 
We 're not in love . 
But I was stupid .

It can be a disadvantage . 
And when we stop doing it , we 'll be dead . 
I 'm really feeling bad lately . 
Didn 't you catch a robber at that time ? 
Oh , the robber . 
I was the one who caught the robber . 
Being lead down an annoying path .

Don 't move , General , if you don 't want to die . 
Every day brings more losses ; new disasters . 
Hatred of that man is unpredictable . 
We 've got to destroy this as soon as possible .

The trouble with real life is , there 's no danger music . 
Poor child of mine . 
If it finds evil , it stops . 
See how they cry . 
What if the lions are less cruel than you ? 
You can 't understand your cruelty .

Without Rayden , it 's hopeless . 
They 're your weakness . 
Pathetic and weak . 
Without your weapons ... you are no match for Motaro . 
I suppose I 'll die . 
I feel fear , anxiety , isolation and darkness . 
Even if we merge , what 's going to happen when i die ? 
I don 't give a shit about that . 
In the worst case . 
Could it explode by accident ? 
They covered his face as if he were dead . 
The bomb exploded two metres away from him . 
Or you 're a dead man ! 
I 'm terribly saddened ... 
Every day brings more losses ; new disasters . 
That man 's hatred ... is unpredictable . 
We 've got to destroy this as soon as possible . 
A society that hates the war . 
Is there no one here who could put an end to his suffering ? 
You 're in danger ? 
She would suffer too much . 
- A crime ? 
I 'II give the signaI to attack . 
He 'II get fuck- aIl .

Robbers and murderers play sabbath in front of the whole world . 
We 'II be doing so weII now that even Saakadze gets jealous . 
ShaII we attack them ? 
Don 't think I 'm blaming you . 
And if one day we 're in trouble ... 
You 're a stupid boy . 
Woe to you , and a buIlet in the head . 
Don 't you hurt this boy , you got me ? 
- Careful , you devil ! 
We must attack the prison . 
It is my burden and mine alone . 
Angela , for example , will die dead . 
You lose . 
I gotta say I 'm not loving it . 
You just ruined our wedding . 
'Cause she 's a bad influence on you , and she always has been . 
How painful it would be to run into one . 
And that Satan will try to discourage you . 
Watch out fag . 
When I was miserable ? 
Why would I choose to have my entire family hate me ? 
I killed my son ! 
Bobby killed himself . 
Why are we wasting it on this ? 
Cease fire ! 
Kill me ! 
My brothers , we must not see only the threat . 
All the same , it will be dangerous . 
Then why have you taken to this dishonorable life of stealing ? 
No , no . 
No right , Bishop Courtenay , no right ? 
There is danger for you here . 
I 'll run but you 're in trouble if you 're late .

The worst of illiterates turn poets 
To seek and destroy .

I believe the situation is very bad . 
May evil be vanquished ! 
Look Sachin , it 's as dangerous for me as it is for you 
Bastards !

- Don 't worry about me , Ma 
You are not happy ? 
Colonel Ravi , this is the turning point of the war 
I don 't want to die . 
And what if we lose ? 
Don 't lose anything . 
There 's a price to be paid for every victory in war 
All you must think of is the enemy ! 
- But you attacked them , didn 't you ? 
One gun fire 
Death is staring him in the face and he 's thinking of his girl ! 
The bastards are sending for reinforcements ! 
My father can 't be wrong 
Bastard 
Bastards ! 
You can launch an attack on Khalubar now 
" that you will complain no more " 
No problems at all . 
Don 't worry . 
We even had some trouble finding your records . 
What the fuck ? 
No , no , no , just a second . 
That is more than all the casualties from all the wars fought ... 
I 'm gonna lose my job . 
I assume that Mr. Grieves got the colonoscopy . 
Mr. Grieves ' procedure was complicated by the fact that -- 
What 's wrong with my leg ?

We hate to see them go . 
You sang " trouble . " 
You know, that was the problem . 
Simon thought it was weak and weird and lacked impact . 
But the myth ignores the squalid reality of violent death . 
And the next day I go out and I steal double . 
He is , to all intents and purposes , dead long before that . 
- Wrong guy . 
We 've run out of the crude planks . 
People are living in poverty and misery . 
Moses needed to be killed .

You 're assaulting me ! 
I 'm broke . 
No , there 's no place for you to try it on . 
Are you scared we 'll be busted ? 
Are you scared of living a poor life ? 
The son- of- a- bitch ! 
Excuse my saying so but I think this is stupidity . 
Considering a couch an investment proves you 're a bad tradesman . 
I 'm tired . 
I didn 't say it was dishonest , honey ! 
You 're not very cheerful either . 
You went to a lot of trouble . 
I want to say something , but don 't get mad . 
Is anyone scared ? 
I swear we sell them for the price of dead sheep . 
And no harm is done to the historical object . 
Terribly hot .

And when we stop doing it , we 'll be dead . 
I 'm really feeling bad lately . 
Didn 't you catch a robber at that time ? 
Oh , the robber . 
I was the one who caught the robber . 
Being lead down an annoying path . 
It 's a fake thing .

Something inside of me didn 't think it was wrong . 
Damn it .

They covered his face as if he were dead . 
The bomb exploded two meters away from him . 
Don 't move , General , if you don 't want to die . 
Every day brings more losses ; new disasters . 
Hatred of that man is unpredictable . 
We 've got to destroy this as soon as possible . 
A society that hates this war . 
Is there no one here who could put an end to his suffering ? 
All right , I 'll have you arrested .

Don 't worry about Robin . 
- Bastard ! 
- He 's a lunatic and a felon . 
What the hell is wrong with you ? 
They fired him for stalking customers . 
The trouble with real life is , there 's no danger music . 
Poor child of mine . 
If it finds evil , it stops . 
See how they cry . 
What if the lions are less cruel than you ? 
You can 't understand your cruelty . 
And now you 're here , hurt , with no force left to fight ... 
You were going to kill that poor couple , why ? 
We will kill her . 
And your eyes turned bad ... ... and ugly .

She and her people have suffered a lot .

The prosecution lawyer may proceed . 
O coward ! 
But there is something I regret . 
I 'd hate to see that happen . 
I ' m going to be broke ! 
But you must fix my problem first . 
But this is nothing ... ... the war is yet to begin . 
He unleashed a storm on poor Geeta !

Your nose isn 't bloody radar ! 
Wouldn 't you be sad , Monique ? 
- Dirty old poof ! 
Don 't be so damn nasty , Antoine ! 
You 'll hurt his feelings . 
Poor people ... they risk their freedom to steal our boredom . 
You 'll be alone with your shame .

Of what was stolen from me ...

I wouldn 't worry about him . 
Negative . 
Something 's wrong . 
I hated her for that . 
What 's your problem ? 
- Did you call moi a dipshit ? 
John , it was stupid of you to go there . 
The data could be called " pain " . 
Chill out , dick- wad . 
- Skynet fights back . 
Why attack Russia ? 
Killing Dyson might prevent the war . 
Oh , shit . 
Shit ! 
Fuck you . 
Earth is under attack . 
You killed my older brother . 
What the hell have you done to yourself this time ? 
Damn it ! 
I 've seen worse , too . 
Without Rayden , it 's hopeless . 
They 're your weakness . 
Pathetic and weak . 
Without your weapons ... you are no match for Motaro . 
I suppose I 'll die . 
I feel fear , anxiety , isolation and darkness . 
Even if we merge , what 's going to happen when i die ? 
I don 't give a shit about that . 
In the worst case . 
Could it explode by accident ? 
They covered his face as if he were dead . 
The bomb exploded two metres away from him . 
Or you 're a dead man ! 
I 'm terribly saddened ... 
Every day brings more losses ; new disasters . 
That man 's hatred ... is unpredictable . 
We 've got to destroy this as soon as possible . 
A society that hates the war . 
Is there no one here who could put an end to his suffering ? 
You 're in danger ? 
She would suffer too much . 
- A crime ? 
I 'II give the signaI to attack . 
He 'II get fuck- aIl . 
May the mercifuI Lord punish me ! 
You know yourself that they 're honest people , but poor . 
May eviI and violence disappear . 
Robbers and murderers play sabbath in front of the whole world . 
We 'II be doing so weII now that even Saakadze gets jealous . 
ShaII we attack them ? 
Don 't think I 'm blaming you . 
And if one day we 're in trouble ... 
You 're a stupid boy . 
Woe to you , and a buIlet in the head . 
Don 't you hurt this boy , you got me ? 
- Careful , you devil ! 
We must attack the prison . 
It is my burden and mine alone . 
Angela , for example , will die dead . 
You lose . 
I gotta say I 'm not loving it . 
You just ruined our wedding . 
'Cause she 's a bad influence on you , and she always has been . 
How painful it would be to run into one . 
And that Satan will try to discourage you . 
Watch out fag . 
When I was miserable ? 
Why would I choose to have my entire family hate me ? 
I killed my son ! 
Bobby killed himself . 
Why are we wasting it on this ? 
Cease fire ! 
Kill me ! 
My brothers , we must not see only the threat . 
All the same , it will be dangerous . 
Then why have you taken to this dishonorable life of stealing ? 
No , no . 
No right , Bishop Courtenay , no right ? 
There is danger for you here . 
I 'll run but you 're in trouble if you 're late . 
- The sinful .

What else can one steal here ? 
Deepak sir ... the enemy will now lie in coffins

There 's said to be some problem there 
I will avenge every death ! 
The worst of illiterates turn poets 
To seek and destroy . 
You 're dead right 
The enemy can 't be seen . 
I believe the situation is very bad . 
May evil be vanquished ! 
Look Sachin , it 's as dangerous for me as it is for you 
Bastards ! 
Don 't worry , Colonel . 
- Don 't worry about me , Ma 
You are not happy ? 
Colonel Ravi , this is the turning point of the war 
I don 't want to die . 
And what if we lose ? 
Don 't lose anything . 
There 's a price to be paid for every victory in war 
All you must think of is the enemy ! 
- But you attacked them , didn 't you ? 
One gun fire 
Death is staring him in the face and he 's thinking of his girl ! 
The bastards are sending for reinforcements ! 
My father can 't be wrong 
Bastard 
Bastards ! 
You can launch an attack on Khalubar now 
" that you will complain no more " 
No problems at all . 
Don 't worry . 
We even had some trouble finding your records . 
What the fuck ? 
No , no , no , just a second . 
That is more than all the casualties from all the wars fought ... 
I 'm gonna lose my job . 
I assume that Mr. Grieves got the colonoscopy . 
Mr. Grieves ' procedure was complicated by the fact that -- 
What 's wrong with my leg ? 
What the fuck were you thinking ? 
Not bad . 
Too bad we 're just colleagues . 
I say let 's be reckless 
- Our car broke down . 
# Left for dead # 
Do you want to know what happens when you die ? 
# So stay and spin and fail and fail # 
That dress is such a paiN .

It was really , really weak . 
Sorry . >> Wrong choice of song for me . 
I ain 't spending no more time wasted 
>> Going to hollywood ! >> I just want to make it really bad . 
We hate to see them go . 
You sang " trouble . " 
You know, that was the problem . 
Simon thought it was weak and weird and lacked impact . 
But the myth ignores the squalid reality of violent death . 
And the next day I go out and I steal double . 
He is , to all intents and purposes , dead long before that . 
- Wrong guy . 
We 've run out of the crude planks . 
People are living in poverty and misery . 
Moses needed to be killed . 
This is an outrage ! 
You 're miserable ? 
Bon voyage , scumbag . 
When I got back here , she was crying . 
Mr Drake was quite badly hurt . 
I shouldn 't be scared ? 
I felt so bad for them . 
We catch criminals . 
No problem , ma 'am . 
You jealous ? 
I haven 't got much bloody choice , have I ? 
You 're assaulting me ! 
I 'm broke . 
No , there 's no place for you to try it on . 
Are you scared we 'll be busted ? 
Are you scared of living a poor life ? 
The son- of- a- bitch ! 
Excuse my saying so but I think this is stupidity . 
Considering a couch an investment proves you 're a bad tradesman . 
I 'm tired . 
I didn 't say it was dishonest , honey ! 
You 're not very cheerful either . 
You went to a lot of trouble . 
I want to say something , but don 't get mad . 
Is anyone scared ? 
I swear we sell them for the price of dead sheep . 
And no harm is done to the historical object . 
Terribly hot . 
It 's not something to be sad about ... 
Go , get the weapons . 
Fuck ! 
Mom ... ... and if they kill you , what should I do ? 
Because they weren 't bad off . 
386 00 : 22 : 29, 191 -- > 00 : 22 : 31, 182 When to kazes , how ?

Are you scared ? 
He was deceived . 
Don 't shoot ! 
- This war confused my plans . 
Prisoners ! 
Almost all of you will die . 
You 'll all be killed . 
You scare off the customers . 
It 's destroying you . 
But to act on it is wrong . 
That 's gonna hurt tomorrow . 
Don 't ever fucking threaten me . 
Rules are made to be broken . 
L 'll lose my voice before opening night . 
You have always been a little crazy - but it seems to be worse . 
Come on , it 's not that great . 
Nobody panics .

Twice as useless ! 
- No one envies us any more . 
He wants to kill everybody ? 
Killing ! 
This is really cruel , Oskar . 
Nothing bad is going to happen to you there . 
Where 's the scam ? 
I could have you arrested . 
I am a criminal . 
She didn 't kill anyone ! 
We 've got no visitations , no phone calls . 
- Don 't worry , I think I 've got a plan . 
This is not my first time inside a prison . 
Fearfully blazing 
And he suffers from palsy That makes his paws shake 
And I once understudied Dick Whittington 's Cat 
But when a crime 's discovered Then Macavity 's not there
