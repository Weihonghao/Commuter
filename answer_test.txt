He was the hot- blooded kind . 
Fortunately , both her husband and I are peaceful men . 
No ... but I got an idea he was laughing at us all the time . 
You lick the hand that feeds you ... the hand that beats you too . 
Lucienne ... you don 't love me anymore ? 
Oh , not white slavery ! 
Foreman , will you please read the verdict ? 
- Be with you in a minute , darling . 
Oh , yes , darling , yes , it 's a lovely day . 
They 're my friends . 
No , I love it . 
Nothing of that kind . 
- Listen , sweetheart . 
That 's lucky . 
Yesterday , you won your first case in five months . 
But , Jan , darling , this isn 't love . 
Why , he 's sweet . 
Why , the way I love you , there 's nothing left to think about . 
Any reason 's good . 
[ ACE LAUGHS ] 
I wish you did . 
- Yes , yes . 
- Yes , I did . 
- I object , Your Honor . 
Good luck , Biberkopf . 
You had a fractured skull and we couldn 't save your arm . 
I did the best I could . 
I did the best I could ! 
But at home , I have a wonderful one . 
Yes , even Franz . 
Promise that you won 't look behind that curtain ! 
It 's a nice day and we will drive a bit around . 
Help ! 
I don 't care about this world anymore , the men and women !

Well , well . 
They just want to have a little fun . 
Help ! 
Pretty stiff . 
And they had money and they were nice 
Perhaps next time you might choose a nicer warehouse .

I adore it so , don 't you ? 
I wish I were . 
It is a great pleasure to meet you , Count . 
You can laugh as much as you want . 
Now , you are interested in spiders . 
When beautiful and plump spiders are not available ... maybe . 
You are strong . 
And I thought you were a wise man . 
Thank God , she is still alive . 
And please open the windows and let some fresh air in . 
You 'll never harm that bat . 
You wanna take all the fun out of life ?

Oh , yes .

Since you moved in , trade 's been pretty slow .

It will be a great day for China when that price is paid . 
I don 't care if you were going to leave with him . 
Please forgive me for my lack of faith . 
It might be a good plan to get them out of the way . 
Well , can 't a girl cry a little bit when she 's happy ?

We 've been sweethearts since we were kids .

But you know , it really is going to be charming . 
I 'd like to see Mr. Gaerste , please . 
That won 't do . 
- Bill , you 'd better take Irene home . 
I could have made good here . 
Better get some sleep . 
Here , you better smoke one of mine . 
What do I care where he gets it ? 
You 're glorifying the gangster by giving him all this publicity . 
Kids aren 't even safe to go to school . 
You better have a drink , Tony .

I find it thrilling . 
Madam the Princess of Chabran wins the first prize in one voice . 
An old friend Loulou invited without telling me . 
And I who went to see it every month , for pleasure . 
A good piece of advice ! 
So you don 't care that your wife is a flirt ! 
It 's perfectly justified , Madam . 
It 's a small price to pay for our happiness . 
" I don 't love you anymore " . 
That won 't do any good to your affairs . 
Yes . 
Well , dear , I decided to come home for dinner after all . 
Yes , sir ! 
Oh , doesn 't look so good at that . 
Well , he can 't move , dear . 
If you get to know 50 beautiful women ... be this way , will you ? 
I 'll wade through the mud and love it . 
I hope I will be lucky enough to find it . 
I want you to accept these as a token of our friendship . 
OK , chief . 
They just laughed at it . 
You better look out . 
That might prove effective . 
Just one more , darling , and then you 'll have to dress .

- Yes . 
Yes .

One feels much safer here than in my bed . 
Thank God it 's only a piece of her . 
I am always OK . 
I won 't tolerate that ! 
I advise you to accept the sentence . 
Yes , you do .

Let me save you . 
I don 't care . 
Well , ladies , let 's combine business with pleasure . 
It simply won 't stand the wear and tear . 
The world 's bright for the first time in three years . 
That 's no way for a great big man to act . 
I 'll give his party special attention . 
To trade the liberty of his associate for his own . 
I expected to meet a lot of interesting people and talk to them . 
That 's funny . 
You 've won . 
I 'll take care of everything in the house . 
It 's true . 
But , Joan , you and Jerry are gonna be so happy . 
I can take care of her , all right . 
I won 't even let him out of my sight . 
You should have complete rest and relaxation . 
Buck didn 't give us time to say good evening . 
If she dies , you won 't have to . 
Yes . 
Yes , there 's a two cent tax on every check you write . 
Well , that 's nice of her . 
I 'd begun to think you weren 't coming to the party . 
What a wise mother . 
Enjoy your ride ? 
You 're very kind . 
Why did you lie to me if it wasn 't true ? 
Yes . 
Yes , there 's a two cent tax on every check you write .

But now you know better , don 't you ? 
You 're very kind . 
Why did you lie to me if it wasn 't true ? 
- Yes , I guess it does . 
- Powerful cider , ain 't it ? 
Everybody loves everybody . 
But you haven 't the comforts ... 
And I 'm as smart now as I ever will be . 
I 've been very happy there . 
Yes , I guess it does . 
Powerful cider , ain 't it , Tom ? 
Everybody loves everybody . 
But you haven 't the comforts ... 
And I 'm as smart now as I ever will be . 
I 've been very happy there . 
But it 's wonderful . 
- I thought she was splendid . 
Yes , I know . 
- Will Mr. Kringelein kindly sign here ? 
Besides , she 's rather pretty . 
I was little , slim , but hard as a diamond . 
- That 's very interesting . 
Save that for the office . 
- You don 't like to see me enjoying myself . 
- He was a nice fellow . 
You always felt better when he came along . 
You loved the Baron , didn 't you ? 
I won 't live long . 
We 'll find a great doctor . 
But it 's wonderful . 
- I thought she was splendid .

Nothing nearly as grand , Lieutenant . 
Well , I 'll tell you , that 's a relief to hear . 
Yes , a logical question . 
I 'd be delighted . 
If I can ever be of any help ... 
I enjoyed it . 
I was clearly in line for the position that you gave George . 
The least I could hope for is some understanding from my wife . 
Born smart , as they say . 
Yes , yes , you 've demonstrated all that . 
Ah , yes , here we are . 
A glorious , torn Paraguayan flag flutters over the fort walls . 
- Yes , yes . 
How beautiful you are , more than ever this evening , Mariù ! 
Speak to me of love , Mariù ! 
Speak to me of love , Mariù ! 
Good night . 
" Do you love China ? " 
Please forgive him ! ... " 
This is a day of joy and happiness for all of us . 
And he didn 't even raise a hand to defend himself 
And God will help you , my boy . 
Yes , yes ... 
Hold yourself in , and save it up for a real Frenchman . 
I 'm not a sick man . 
To make a long story short , I wish to marry Elsa . 
Wonderful day . 
It was inspiration as it only had been given to you by God . 
Always trusting , believing anybody . 
Be a good girl , please stay in that room with your grandmother . 
I think you 'd better go back tonight . 
Open unto us the door of thy loving- kindness 
Hit the sympathy seeker ! 
The sympathy seeker ! 
Work ; but your strength let union teach . 
# To break - why then , to- morrow , truly , 
# Help me ??? . 
That book is outstanding ! 
In memory of my dad , help me . 
But I 'm waiting since three years , dear ! 
Do you mean that he has got time to be happy ? ... 
- So , do you like it here ? 
You won 't find anything cleaner in the world . 
I don 't care if he is your son . 
In her heart , she 'll be happy . 
To speak to me like that ! 
It 's not as if your mother doesn 't love you . 
Yes .

Half an hour ago , we were chatting like old friends , 
If that makes you happy . 
Yes . 
But now get up , darling . 
Yes yes yes yes 
Not yet enough success ? 
They stole his poetry and faith ... and then they dropped him . 
Cheers .

Because of the excitement .
