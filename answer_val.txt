It 's Black Elk and some of his braves . 
No great trail was ever blazed without hardship . 
It 's frontier justice . 
It may help me . 
- No , I never killed a dead one . 
Do you mind if I say good night ?

How handsome my Alexis was in his dress uniform . 
He was the hot- blooded kind . 
Fortunately , both her husband and I are peaceful men . 
No â€¦ but I got an idea he was laughing at us all the time . 
You lick the hand that feeds you â€¦ the hand that beats you too . 
Lucienne â€¦ you donâ€™ t love me anymore ? 
Oh , not white slavery ! 
Foreman , will you please read the verdict ?
