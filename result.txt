--------------------
It 's nonsense . 
Just being a friend . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're scary when you 're mad . 
I won 't do it again . 
--------------------
--------------------
Because you 're tired and your leg 's hurt . 
It won 't happen again . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm almost there , No , you 're tired . 
Okay , okay . 
--------------------
--------------------
- You 're bad . 
I 'm very good to him . 
--------------------
--------------------
You think I 'm stupid ? 
He 's just a friend who gave me a lift . 
--------------------
--------------------
- It 's my first time , will it hurt ? 
- I 'll be gentle . 
--------------------
--------------------
Do you think I would cheat ? 
You 're good at it . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Don 't worry . 
Thanks .

--------------------
I hate the water ! 
Do you ... have a lover ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Now don 't scream ! 
I sang your praises . 
--------------------
--------------------
I felt guilty because you 'd left . 
He said you were a great girl ... 
--------------------
--------------------
But that girl can be so possessive ... no way to get rid of her . 
But I think she 's really fond of you . 
--------------------
--------------------
It upset my plans , which were upset anyway . 
He backed off , and I missed a great chance ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't talk nonsense ! 
OK , let 's talk about Lea ! 
--------------------
--------------------
This your revenge ? 
Certainly not ! 
--------------------
--------------------
We 're not in love . 
You love someone else . 
--------------------
--------------------
But I was stupid . 
I love Fabien . 
--------------------
--------------------
lf ever you know anything awkward , I forbid you to tell me . 
For now , we 're euphoric . 
--------------------
--------------------
I broke up with Fabien ! 
This time it 's for good . 
--------------------
--------------------
It can be a disadvantage . 
They seek me out , so I just relax . 
--------------------
--------------------
And when we stop doing it , we 'll be dead .

--------------------
--------------------
I 'm really feeling bad lately . 
Thank you ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Didn 't you catch a robber at that time ? 
Didn 't you get a thank- you gift ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , the robber . 
I 'm not a robber . 
--------------------
--------------------
I was the one who caught the robber . 
Yes , the scooter . 
--------------------
--------------------
Being lead down an annoying path . 
I honestly don 't know where this is going . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's a fake thing . 
There 's no unconditional love . 
--------------------
--------------------
I am scared . 
You got , like , this perfect life . 
--------------------
--------------------
So she 's gonna kill it . 
Well , it does seem cleaner . 
--------------------
--------------------
Something inside of me didn 't think it was wrong . 
It 's like a dream . 
--------------------
--------------------
Damn it . 
I was hoping you weren 't going to ask her that . 
--------------------
--------------------
Why the hell would you say they were ? 
To make them happy . 
--------------------
--------------------
Why their place had no music , no view , no decor . 
- But if you can 't feel pleasure , what 's with the cocaine ? 
--------------------
--------------------
but she could get stressed by daddy dying . 
You don 't know if we 'll get better ? 
--------------------
--------------------
If he doesn 't have fmf , the colchicine will kill him . 
Boy , sure hope I 'm right . 
--------------------
--------------------
I don 't -- I don 't want to be a loser . 
You 're not a loser . 
--------------------
--------------------
with hormones , and emotion , and fear , and ... 
You just can 't make a huge decision like this right now . 
--------------------
--------------------
* It worries me sometimes * 
* That I want love * 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's too bad . 
You would 've made a great mother . 
--------------------
--------------------
you told me I 'd suck as a mother . 
Now that I 've lost it , you tell me I 'd be great as a mother . 
--------------------
--------------------
My problem is that it 's a bad idea 
To mix business and pleasure . 
--------------------
--------------------
What a hurtful thing to say , 
Especially given how generous I 've been to your family . 
--------------------
--------------------
No problem . 
I love you . 
--------------------
--------------------
To behave in reckless ways . 
And when the pursuit of our heart 's desire 
--------------------
--------------------
No bad influences , right ? 
You take care of him , Cecil . 
--------------------
--------------------
You fucking shit yourself . 
- Anyway , look , good to see you , boys . 
--------------------
--------------------
Suck his cock . 
Enjoy that , did you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's my first night , for fuck 's sake . 
Remember , Cass , you can 't trust none of them , mate . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fucking cunt ! 
Look , just look fucking smart , all right ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You bastard . 
I 'm always fucking smart . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Are you keeping out of trouble , though ? 
- I 've always been a good boy , Mum . 
--------------------
--------------------
Jealous cunt . 
But what they forget is the pleasure of it . 
--------------------
--------------------
Pure as the driven snow , that shit you done . 
After all , we 're not fucking stupid . 
--------------------
--------------------
When this hard cunt comes in . 
Obviously fucking fancied himself like . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Who the fuck are you ? 
- Oh , Lizzy , you 've been so good to me . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Trouble is coming - Temptation 
- It 's just the high cost of loving - Temptation 
--------------------
--------------------
A little bit crazy , a little bit bad . 
But , hey , don 't us girls just love that ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- It 's no problem for me either . 
- I 'd rather take care of it myself . 
--------------------
--------------------
I thought I was gonna lose you there . 
You 're nothin ' but trouble to me , but I still love you . 
--------------------
--------------------
Bitch ! 
Well ... this is a good fucking laugh , isn 't it ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Whatever . I mean , the guy 's dead anyway . 
Iggy Pop is not dead . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fucking listen to me , you piece of junkie shit . 
A joke 's a fucking joke . 
--------------------
--------------------
He never knew you could get toxoplasmosis from cat shit . 
A loving man who had a great lust for life . 
--------------------
--------------------
- For fuck 's sake ! 
- Fucking nice one , Franco ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Fool , you need it most .. zip up and sit tight ! 
Alright here we go .. everything is gonna be fine . 
--------------------
--------------------
You see , don 't worry . 
I know how to win these females over ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You don 't worry . 
I 'II win her over for you ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Leave these smaII worries for a smaII fish Iike me .. ! 
You relax Anna ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I don 't hate anybody Anna .. 
I have only loved .. 
--------------------
--------------------
Nonsense persons !! 
Your love was true ! 
--------------------
--------------------
We can 't detain any longer . 
Dear Nina ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I don 't give a shit about that . 
He doesn 't care about them . 
--------------------
--------------------
In the worst case . 
I 'd like to tell you , that I respect you . 
--------------------
--------------------
Could it explode by accident ? 
Dear Nina ! 
--------------------
--------------------
They covered his face as if he were dead . 
Nobody would have survived such an explosion . 
--------------------
--------------------
The bomb exploded two meters away from him . 
He can 't have survived . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't move , General , if you don 't want to die . 
I thought you were more clever , Stauffenberg . 
--------------------
--------------------
Every day brings more losses ; new disasters . 
The only thing we want is a permanent peace . 
--------------------
--------------------
Hatred of that man is unpredictable . 
We won 't lie down . 
--------------------
--------------------
We 've got to destroy this as soon as possible . 
It won 't change anything . 
--------------------
--------------------
A society that hates this war . 
And which wishes peace and freedom for everybody . 
--------------------
--------------------
Is there no one here who could put an end to his suffering ? 
Pridun , take care of this . 
--------------------
--------------------
All right , I 'll have you arrested . 
Does any of you want to write anything for the good- bye ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Always loitering and fooling around 
Ask that asshole to take care of the customers 
--------------------
--------------------
Really , there 's no need to pay , Master Ip 
You 're too kind Don 't be 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't have to worry 
Whatever valuables in the house have been pawned 
--------------------
--------------------
Idiot ! 
If you win there is a bag of rice 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're crazy ! 
Don 't be like this ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I am really useless 
I don 't care what the outside world is like 
--------------------
--------------------
I 've always thought that you practice kung fu is not practical 
Now I know it 's quite useful 
--------------------
--------------------
Teach our Imperial Army Chinese kung fu 
Then , you would have half the chance of surviving 
--------------------
--------------------
He says he admires you wants you to teach Japanese Chinese kung fu 
I won 't teach Japanese !

You have massacred the poor guy ! 
You think you can make our father proud of you this way ? 
--------------------
--------------------
What a stupid idea ! 
Painting the plane in bright red ...

Well , the whole war seems to be a family affair . 
Especially you aristocrats seem to love it . 
--------------------
--------------------
You are injured , you can 't fly yet ! 
I won 't let them butcher us like that . 
--------------------
--------------------
I will fight on your and Lothar 's side !

Don 't you worry about her . 
She 's a very good friend of mine .

If he 's dead , that 's the third time this year .

- I 'll get that for you , don 't you worry . 
- I think I can do better than that .

Lost to the world of degenerate , stoned no- hopers . 
Never to be seen again by the eye of a clean soul .

Eric Roberts is Sam and Stan Sweet in " Brother Sweet Brother " . 
--------------------
--------------------
Frankly I 'm sick of hearing it . 
He 's a good man . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry about Robin . 
I 'll take care of her . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Bastard ! 
- Let 's just have a good time . 
--------------------
--------------------
- He 's a lunatic and a felon . 
- Everybody just relax . 
--------------------
--------------------
What the hell is wrong with you ? 
Thanks for the delightful evening . 
--------------------
--------------------
They fired him for stalking customers . 
You better lock up tight . 
--------------------
--------------------
The trouble with real life is , there 's no danger music . 
Nice jump , Spiderman ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Poor child of mine . 
Yes , Governor . 
--------------------
--------------------
If it finds evil , it stops . 
And when it goes , Good starts to shine ... ... as if by miracle . 
--------------------
--------------------
See how they cry . 
How beautiful ! 
--------------------
--------------------
What if the lions are less cruel than you ? 
What if someday he comes back to bring the peace ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You can 't understand your cruelty . 
Because you don 't know what love is . 
--------------------
--------------------
And now you 're here , hurt , with no force left to fight ... 
For Love ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You were going to kill that poor couple , why ? 
Because they 're in love . 
--------------------
--------------------
We will kill her . 
Because he loves only me . 
--------------------
--------------------
And your eyes turned bad ... ... and ugly . 
You 're lucky that I can 't move . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Do it , Idiot . 
Look , Look , he 's alive ! 
--------------------
--------------------
She and her people have suffered a lot . 
It is easy to be good when you 're happy . 
--------------------
--------------------
- And you unleashed all this ruin . 
To make justice . 
--------------------
--------------------
Bastard ! 
All you think of is laughter and booze . 
--------------------
--------------------
And tell all that the King fears nothing ! 
Because the tournament champion is with him . 
--------------------
--------------------
What is this nonsense ! 
Because of people like you today Muslims ' plight is like this ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Mullah sir has harassed the foreigners a lot . 
Television has made my work easy . 
--------------------
--------------------
Like telling lies is forbidden . 
Like gambling ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Brother is unnecessarily getting angry . 
I just don 't feel like going ! 
--------------------
--------------------
But I have no complains now . 
Now I can proudly say that I 've the best father in the world ! 
--------------------
--------------------
This is deceiving ! 
But my dear he is a fair foreigner . 
--------------------
--------------------
All went waste . 
- Yes , true . 
--------------------
--------------------
He is one of those terrorists . 
Why is he enjoying his life with you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
The prosecution lawyer may proceed . 
I 'll tell the truth , nothing but the truth . 
--------------------
--------------------
O coward ! 
O honor- less ! 
--------------------
--------------------
But there is something I regret . 
I have not given you any happiness in life . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'd hate to see that happen . 
Which is why I will certainly join you for lunch today . 
--------------------
--------------------
I ' m going to be broke ! 
This is the tax you pay for the fun you have , Bhandari ! 
--------------------
--------------------
But you must fix my problem first . 
- Make me a great betel- leaf . 
--------------------
--------------------
But this is nothing ... ... the war is yet to begin . 
So bless me , mother ... 
--------------------
--------------------
He unleashed a storm on poor Geeta ! 
Yes ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- You ' re hurt ! 
- Yes ... ... it must 've peeled my hand when I lifted the car . 
--------------------
--------------------
No man can ever live only on hatred and malice . 
You could have tried asking someone for her love and affection ... 
--------------------
--------------------
I can 't understand any of your nonsense ! 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't sulk , no need to be jealous . 
Here 's a little bonus . 
--------------------
--------------------
Your nose isn 't bloody radar ! 
It 's a 'state of grace ' . 
--------------------
--------------------
Wouldn 't you be sad , Monique ? 
Go ahead and laugh ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- Dirty old poof ! 
- Easy does it , boys ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't be so damn nasty , Antoine ! 
Bob 's a wonderful friend . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 'll hurt his feelings . 
Forget it sweetheart , it 's OK . 
--------------------
--------------------
Poor people ... they risk their freedom to steal our boredom . 
We have a lot of fun , really . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 'll be alone with your shame . 
But I 'll turn it to happiness ... a bouquet of flowers . 
--------------------
--------------------
- You really are a slut . 
- That 's why we get on so well . 
--------------------
--------------------
I was sad ... 
I needed affection ... 
--------------------
--------------------
Of what was stolen from me ... 
I 'll give you back your dreams ... 
--------------------
--------------------
- Cut the crap , it 's no time ... 
Relax , I 'll take a look . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Bob , you bastard ! 
- Choose your friends more carefully . 
--------------------
--------------------
- I can 't , he 's got a gun ! 
He won 't taste heaven with you , slag ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- Bastard ! 
- I 'm not a bastard ! 
--------------------
--------------------
We 're tired , girls . 
We need a holiday in the tropics . 
--------------------
--------------------
Victor , NO ! 
Ready ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Too bad . 
Well , well , well ... 
--------------------
--------------------
I can give you the tools to defeat him . 
- How we can still save the others . 
--------------------
--------------------
Goddamn it , John ! 
We hunted our own kind , Logan . 
--------------------
--------------------
Large blind 's a hundred , small blind 's fifty . 
May I give you a hand ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Shoot on sight ! 
I can help . 
--------------------
--------------------
Where the hell am I ? 
Listen , I am a friend . 
--------------------
--------------------
Emptiness . 
Warmth . 
--------------------
--------------------
The government will lose this time . 
Or so I hope . 
--------------------
--------------------
Where the hell are they ? 
Do you often fall in love ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I swear , I have had it with that goddamn kid . 
- He won 't even answer me anymore . 
--------------------
--------------------
I wouldn 't worry about him . 
Thanks for your cooperation . 
--------------------
--------------------
Negative . 
The T- 1000 would definitely try to reacquire you there . 
--------------------
--------------------
Something 's wrong . 
She 's never this nice . 
--------------------
--------------------
I hated her for that . 
But everything she said was true . 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's your problem ? 
Help ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- Did you call moi a dipshit ? 
- Just trying to help this punk . 
--------------------
--------------------
John , it was stupid of you to go there . 
You have to be smarter than that . 
--------------------
--------------------
The data could be called " pain " . 
John , help me with the light . 
--------------------
--------------------
Chill out , dick- wad . 
That 's great . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Skynet fights back . 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Why attack Russia ? 
Aren 't they our friends now ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Killing Dyson might prevent the war . 
I don 't care ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , shit . 
Not good . 
--------------------
--------------------
Shit ! 
She 's in the clean room . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fuck you . 
Help ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Earth is under attack . 
And it is glorious ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You killed my older brother . 
So , why did you help us ? 
--------------------
--------------------
What the hell have you done to yourself this time ? 
Cybernetic strength- enhancers . 
--------------------
--------------------
Damn it ! 
I can 't get you free Jax . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 've seen worse , too . 
If you are Nightwolf , you know I won Mortal Kombat . 
--------------------
--------------------
Without Rayden , it 's hopeless . 
Never give up hope . 
--------------------
--------------------
They 're your weakness . 
Oh , well thanks for the tip . 
--------------------
--------------------
Pathetic and weak . 
Clearly Rayden has molded you in his image . 
--------------------
--------------------
Without your weapons ... you are no match for Motaro . 
Jax , help ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I suppose I 'll die . 
Or maybe you 'd save me , 
--------------------
--------------------
I feel fear , anxiety , isolation and darkness . 
Sometimes I feel hope ... ... 
--------------------
--------------------
Even if we merge , what 's going to happen when i die ? 
My genes won 't remain even as copies . 
--------------------
--------------------
I don 't give a shit about that . 
He doesn 't care about them . 
--------------------
--------------------
In the worst case . 
I 'd like to tell you , that I respect you . 
--------------------
--------------------
Could it explode by accident ? 
Dear Nina ! 
--------------------
--------------------
They covered his face as if he were dead . 
Nobody would have survived such an explosion . 
--------------------
--------------------
The bomb exploded two metres away from him . 
He can 't have survived . 
--------------------
--------------------
Or you 're a dead man ! 
I thought you were more clever , Stauffenberg . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm terribly saddened ... 
I was just informed , that our beloved Fuhrer 
--------------------
--------------------
Every day brings more losses ; new disasters . 
The only thing we want is a permanent peace . 
--------------------
--------------------
That man 's hatred ... is unpredictable . 
We won 't lie down . 
--------------------
--------------------
We 've got to destroy this as soon as possible . 
It won 't change anything . 
--------------------
--------------------
A society that hates the war . 
And wishes peace and freedom for everybody . 
--------------------
--------------------
Is there no one here who could put an end to his suffering ? 
Pridun , take care of this . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're in danger ? 
OK , I 'm coming . 
--------------------
--------------------
She would suffer too much . 
Satisfied ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- A crime ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'II give the signaI to attack . 
Take care of her . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 'II get fuck- aIl . 
Like heIl ! 
--------------------
--------------------
May the mercifuI Lord punish me ! 
May I have no joy in this Iife ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You know yourself that they 're honest people , but poor . 
Honest , you say ! 
--------------------
--------------------
May eviI and violence disappear . 
May honesty and nobleness win . 
--------------------
--------------------
Robbers and murderers play sabbath in front of the whole world . 
Throwing their hats up in the heavens , as the saying goes . 
--------------------
--------------------
We 'II be doing so weII now that even Saakadze gets jealous . 
I didn 't come here for you making fun of me . 
--------------------
--------------------
ShaII we attack them ? 
No , they invite us in good faith . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't think I 'm blaming you . 
On the contrary , I feeI a strange desire to help you . 
--------------------
--------------------
And if one day we 're in trouble ... 
I 'II be happy to do for you what I can . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're a stupid boy . 
Why do you care for sweets ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Woe to you , and a buIlet in the head . 
Please don 't kiII me , my dears . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't you hurt this boy , you got me ? 
I 'II never hurt him , Ilo , my dear , only don 't kiII me . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Careful , you devil ! 
- Take it easy , Ilo . 
--------------------
--------------------
We must attack the prison . 
And free Simon . 
--------------------
--------------------
It is my burden and mine alone . 
- I 'll be repaying the favor very soon . 
--------------------
--------------------
Angela , for example , will die dead . 
[ Laughing ] 
--------------------
--------------------
You lose . 
Your wedding better watch it . 
--------------------
--------------------
I gotta say I 'm not loving it . 
No , but you were both so good . 
--------------------
--------------------
You just ruined our wedding . 
You happy now ? 
--------------------
--------------------
'Cause she 's a bad influence on you , and she always has been . 
Judging by that DVD , you 're a lot more like her than I thought . 
--------------------
--------------------
How painful it would be to run into one . 
I wonder if I 'll ever be free again . 
--------------------
--------------------
And that Satan will try to discourage you . 
Do you trust in god ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Watch out fag . 
Did you tell your friends ? 
--------------------
--------------------
When I was miserable ? 
That looked like I was getting better ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Why would I choose to have my entire family hate me ? 
No we love you . 
--------------------
--------------------
I killed my son ! 
You did not kill your son . 
--------------------
--------------------
Bobby killed himself . 
How could God forgive me ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Why are we wasting it on this ? 
Alright , alright . 
--------------------
--------------------
Cease fire ! 
Woo , Scott , follow me ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Kill me ! 
I don 't care . 
--------------------
--------------------
My brothers , we must not see only the threat . 
I have longed for this opportunity . 
--------------------
--------------------
All the same , it will be dangerous . 
Promise me ... you 'll be careful . 
--------------------
--------------------
Then why have you taken to this dishonorable life of stealing ? 
Well , you know as well as I do , Father . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no . 
Have you ever heard of the great King David ? 
--------------------
--------------------
No right , Bishop Courtenay , no right ? 
The Queen Mother has spoken and we shall listen respectfully . 
--------------------
--------------------
There is danger for you here . 
In Prague you would be honored , as you deserve . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'll run but you 're in trouble if you 're late . 
We won 't , I 'll put these in water . 
--------------------
--------------------
- The sinful . 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
What can you explain , bastard ? ! 
- Sweetie ! 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's wrong with you ? ! 
You relax ! 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's wrong ? 
You can 't trust them . 
--------------------
--------------------
This sucks ! 
I 'm her best friend and I don 't know her twin ! 
--------------------
--------------------
What else can one steal here ? 
It 's either the splendour of nature or the chill of ice 
--------------------
--------------------
Deepak sir ... the enemy will now lie in coffins 
Let 's hope so 
--------------------
--------------------
0 And the idiot didn 't even try to get in touch with us 
I hope the patrol party is okay ! 
--------------------
--------------------
There 's said to be some problem there 
That 's nice . 
--------------------
--------------------
I will avenge every death ! 
Right now I 'm not thinking of revenge . 
--------------------
--------------------
The worst of illiterates turn poets 
Praised be Krishna . 
--------------------
--------------------
To seek and destroy . 
- Yes , sir 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're dead right 
Too wise for your age 
--------------------
--------------------
The enemy can 't be seen . 
We can 't assess their strength either 
--------------------
--------------------
I believe the situation is very bad . 
- Yes , sir . 
--------------------
--------------------
May evil be vanquished ! 
May there be compassion 
--------------------
--------------------
Look Sachin , it 's as dangerous for me as it is for you 
Just relax . 
--------------------
--------------------
Bastards ! 
I don 't care , Balwan 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry , Colonel . 
Victory and glory will be ours 
--------------------
--------------------
- Don 't worry about me , Ma 
You take care of yourself 
--------------------
--------------------
You are not happy ? 
Happy about what , sir ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Colonel Ravi , this is the turning point of the war 
You and your boys have done a great job 
--------------------
--------------------
I don 't want to die . 
Save me 
--------------------
--------------------
And what if we lose ? 
Some goals are so worthy , it 's glorious even to feel 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't lose anything . 
And yes ... 
--------------------
--------------------
There 's a price to be paid for every victory in war 
I just lost dear friend . 
--------------------
--------------------
All you must think of is the enemy ! 
- Yes , sir 
--------------------
--------------------
- But you attacked them , didn 't you ? 
God bless our JCO Zakeer Husain who suggested the idea 
--------------------
--------------------
One gun fire 
Good shot , brother . 
--------------------
--------------------
Death is staring him in the face and he 's thinking of his girl ! 
Yes , sir . 
--------------------
--------------------
The bastards are sending for reinforcements ! 
I 'll go and fetch our friends 
--------------------
--------------------
My father can 't be wrong 
I 'm not going to die . 
--------------------
--------------------
Bastard 
I won 't spare them ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Bastards ! 
I won 't spare anyone ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You can launch an attack on Khalubar now 
God bless the soldier 
--------------------
--------------------
" that you will complain no more " 
" The ones you love ... " 
--------------------
--------------------
No problems at all . 
Safe to say there was nothing left to hit the fan . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry . 
It 's perfectly normal . 
--------------------
--------------------
We even had some trouble finding your records . 
But as we gastroenterologists are very fond of saying : 
--------------------
--------------------
What the fuck ? 
Thanks . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no , no , just a second . 
This is so cool . 
--------------------
--------------------
That is more than all the casualties from all the wars fought ... 
- ... in the history of the United States . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm gonna lose my job . 
You 'll get a better one . 
--------------------
--------------------
I assume that Mr. Grieves got the colonoscopy . 
- Yes , actually -- - I wasn 't fucking talking to you . 
--------------------
--------------------
Mr. Grieves ' procedure was complicated by the fact that -- 
The fact that he wasn 't clean , he wasn 't prepared ? 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's wrong with my leg ? 
You 've tested positive for a group- A streptococcal infection . 
--------------------
--------------------
What the fuck were you thinking ? 
Hi , sweetheart . 
--------------------
--------------------
Not bad . 
Yeah sure . 
--------------------
--------------------
Too bad we 're just colleagues . 
Pretty busy up here . 
--------------------
--------------------
I say let 's be reckless 
Rather than feckless What good is that ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- Our car broke down . 
Your friend okay ? . 
--------------------
--------------------
# Left for dead # 
# Left for good # 
--------------------
--------------------
Do you want to know what happens when you die ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
# So stay and spin and fail and fail # 
# Who 'll ever win # 
--------------------
--------------------
That dress is such a paiN . 
Right ? >> Yes . >> If you want to vote for melinda : 
--------------------
--------------------
little boy , huh ? >> NO . 
I have a lot of respect for diana ross . 
--------------------
--------------------
It wasn 't terrible . 
It wasn 't fantastic . 
--------------------
--------------------
It was really , really weak . 
You know what i love about you . ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Sorry . >> Wrong choice of song for me . 
I don 't feel this was your best performance . >> ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I ain 't spending no more time wasted 
( cheers and applause ) 
--------------------
--------------------
>> Going to hollywood ! >> I just want to make it really bad . 
>> You ready for the truth ? 
--------------------
--------------------
We hate to see them go . 
We have a great show to help ease the pain . 
--------------------
--------------------
You sang " trouble . " 
Randy loved your big voicE . 
--------------------
--------------------
You know, that was the problem . 
You are not a bad singer, actually . 
--------------------
--------------------
Simon thought it was weak and weird and lacked impact . 
A. J. , You sang " feeling good . " 
--------------------
--------------------
But the myth ignores the squalid reality of violent death . 
The western hero has simple religious beliefs . 
--------------------
--------------------
And the next day I go out and I steal double . 
And then I feel happy . 
--------------------
--------------------
He is , to all intents and purposes , dead long before that . 
The ones that I 've witnessed were very easy . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Wrong guy . 
Yes ? 
--------------------
--------------------
We 've run out of the crude planks . 
It 's clean now . 
--------------------
--------------------
People are living in poverty and misery . 
Although with all those pesos we could build a better society . 
--------------------
--------------------
Moses needed to be killed . 
And only one interested will be soon six feet under . 
--------------------
--------------------
This is an outrage ! 
I made it quite clear , DI Drake - either with me or against me . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're miserable ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Bon voyage , scumbag . 
Well , I hope you 're all proud of yourselves . 
--------------------
--------------------
When I got back here , she was crying . 
You 're going to have to be really strong for her . 
--------------------
--------------------
Mr Drake was quite badly hurt . 
He 's a lovely man . 
--------------------
--------------------
I shouldn 't be scared ? 
Well , I had to make sure you were the person I was looking for . 
--------------------
--------------------
I felt so bad for them . 
But not bad enough that you couldn 't come to us ? 
--------------------
--------------------
We catch criminals . 
It 's what we do best . 
--------------------
--------------------
No problem , ma 'am . 
Have a good night . 
--------------------
--------------------
You jealous ? 
Don 't flatter yourself , sweetheart . 
--------------------
--------------------
I haven 't got much bloody choice , have I ? 
You 're not such a bad copper , you know . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're assaulting me ! 
As if it 's that easy ... 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm broke . 
Do you accept credit cards ? 
--------------------
--------------------
No , there 's no place for you to try it on . 
This is my favorite shade of blue . 
--------------------
--------------------
Are you scared we 'll be busted ? 
" A handsome shop owner " . 
--------------------
--------------------
Are you scared of living a poor life ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
The son- of- a- bitch ! 
That 's even better . 
--------------------
--------------------
Excuse my saying so but I think this is stupidity . 
You know best . 
--------------------
--------------------
Considering a couch an investment proves you 're a bad tradesman . 
What 's a good tradesman doing here ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm tired . 
But we had a lot of fun . 
--------------------
--------------------
I didn 't say it was dishonest , honey ! 
Can anybody be as honest as you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're not very cheerful either . 
Look Selim , I hope you 're not worried about this . 
--------------------
--------------------
You went to a lot of trouble . 
Thanks a lot Selim . 
--------------------
--------------------
I want to say something , but don 't get mad . 
Just so I 'll feel confident . 
--------------------
--------------------
Is anyone scared ? 
I 'm very happy . 
--------------------
--------------------
I swear we sell them for the price of dead sheep . 
Well , good- bye now . 
--------------------
--------------------
And no harm is done to the historical object . 
It may be against the law but it 's not a sin . 
--------------------
--------------------
Terribly hot . 
I love this , look . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's not something to be sad about ... 
Why aren 't you glad ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Go , get the weapons . 
Don 't trust nobody , only your family . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fuck ! 
Good Evening . 
--------------------
--------------------
Mom ... ... and if they kill you , what should I do ? 
That won 't happen . 
--------------------
--------------------
Because they weren 't bad off . 
They were winning . 
--------------------
--------------------
386 00 : 22 : 29, 191 -- > 00 : 22 : 31, 182 When to kazes , how ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
I mean , I know that is in distress . 
That 's why I requested you to help me .

- Good . 
--------------------
--------------------
Are you scared ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
He was deceived . 
He 's very kind . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't shoot ! 
Take them alive ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- This war confused my plans . 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Prisoners ! 
I 'm not wrong ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Almost all of you will die . 
And that will be good . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 'll all be killed . 
lf you want to stay alive , I 'll get you out . 
--------------------
--------------------
You scare off the customers . 
It would benefit everyone if you left Bente . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's destroying you . 
The union won 't like you forcing me to leave my wife . 
--------------------
--------------------
But to act on it is wrong . 
Put distance between the heart and the hand . 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's gonna hurt tomorrow . 
- Yup , I nailed him good . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't ever fucking threaten me . 
And you better lay off hitting Bente . 
--------------------
--------------------
Rules are made to be broken . 
Alf said a clever thing . 
--------------------
--------------------
L 'll lose my voice before opening night . 
And you showing up , doesn 't help . 
--------------------
--------------------
You have always been a little crazy - but it seems to be worse . 
You need help . 
--------------------
--------------------
Come on , it 's not that great . 
- Yes , it is . 
--------------------
--------------------
Nobody panics . 
They 're good . 
--------------------
--------------------
- It 's not good enough ! 
Not good enough ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Twice as useless ! 
- Yes , yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
- No one envies us any more . 
- I 'm smart ! 
--------------------
--------------------
He wants to kill everybody ? 
Great ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Killing ! 
He can 't enjoy it . 
--------------------
--------------------
This is really cruel , Oskar . 
You are giving them hope . 
--------------------
--------------------
Nothing bad is going to happen to you there . 
You 'll receive special treatment . 
--------------------
--------------------
Where 's the scam ? 
It 's good business . 
--------------------
--------------------
I could have you arrested . 
I 'm protected by powerful friends . 
--------------------
--------------------
I am a criminal . 
At midnight you 'll be free , and I 'll be hunted . 
--------------------
--------------------
She didn 't kill anyone ! 
Funny . 
--------------------
--------------------
We 've got no visitations , no phone calls . 
It 's clean . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Don 't worry , I think I 've got a plan . 
But we 're gonna need some help from an old friend . 
--------------------
--------------------
This is not my first time inside a prison . 
But hopefully ... 
--------------------
--------------------
Fearfully blazing 
He gave a great yawn 
--------------------
--------------------
And he suffers from palsy That makes his paws shake 
Yet he was in his youth Quite the smartest of cats 
--------------------
--------------------
And I once understudied Dick Whittington 's Cat 
But my grandest creation 
--------------------
--------------------
But when a crime 's discovered Then Macavity 's not there 
He 's outwardly respectable 
--------------------
--------------------
No problem , Mr. Peterson . 
Enjoy your stay . 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , shit . 
Yes ! 
--------------------
--------------------
What the fuck are you doing here ? 
I don 't care what this guy did , all right ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Someone 's still hurting from a bad break- up . 
Beautiful and wise . 
--------------------
--------------------
Trunk line three , negative lock . 
Transit trunk node Bravo four is active . 
--------------------
--------------------
Negative lockout . 
Intel set tracer active . 
--------------------
--------------------
Negative lockout . 
Target SlM just went active . 
--------------------
--------------------
And this only failed by one vote . 
I bet the folks back in Omaha are glad that didn 't pass . 
--------------------
--------------------
Your seatbelt 's broken . 
It won 't fasten . 
--------------------
--------------------
They think something wrong . 
Welcome to Moscow . 
--------------------
--------------------
Echelon knew flight 4400 would crash . 
Yes , with probability of 94 . 67 % . 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , shit . 
All right , on yourfeet , Grant ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Listen to people who hurt you . 
- Listen to Muhammad - Muhammad is generous itself . 
--------------------
--------------------
Your prophet is a fraud , Kill him ! 
- Protect the Prophet Protéjanlo of the guards !

- Only weaker left - Ruin our reputation . 
We are honest traders .

I 'm not afraid of what lies ahead of me . 
Glory to Hubal !

- If ... but you were the most bitter sword against Islam . 
Now , by God 's ... adjourn the top is a sword in his name . 
--------------------
--------------------
( whines ) 
It 'll do you a lot of good . 
--------------------
--------------------
Hell of a life bein ' a mountie , ain 't it , kid ? 
Yeah , great . 
--------------------
--------------------
Goddamn ! 
Help me , somebody ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Jimmy Tom is dead ! 
I 'll take care of it . 
--------------------
--------------------
Jimmy Tom is dead ! 
I told you I would take care of it . 
--------------------
--------------------
The dead body over there ... ... probably has your bullet in him . 
I have a pretty fair idea what happened out here . 
--------------------
--------------------
Hell of a way for a man to die - being blown up . 
Yeah - be a good man to have on your side . 
--------------------
--------------------
As long as there 's a war going on , you 're my responsibility . 
I can take care of myself . 
--------------------
--------------------
Moron . 
Funny . 
--------------------
--------------------
Shit ! 
Thank goodness . 
--------------------
--------------------
Who that motherfucker ? 
Great country . 
--------------------
--------------------
People don 't get soft in prison . 
Pretty good . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's got a bad attitude . 
Who 's your friend ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You ain 't the only one that knows some shit . 
Good job , my man . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Damn , that was hot . 
- Thanks . 
--------------------
--------------------
What the hell you doing ? ! 
I hope you land on your feet , grasshopper . 
--------------------
--------------------
Such an ugly word . 
Encouraging ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- Shit ! 
This just got interesting . 
--------------------
--------------------
Yeah , prison food tastes like shit . 
Yes , it does . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fuck you ! 
Very clever . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's my fault . 
She 's not gonna die , Danny . 
--------------------
--------------------
Sorry , Danny , you lose . 
And now Round 9 is gonna be so much fun . 
--------------------
--------------------
A new form of terrorism threatens us . 
More powerful . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Terrorists ? 
- I think , yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
But one false step would destroy what has taken years to build . 
Power , trust and respect for Africans . 
--------------------
--------------------
It was picked up 17 dead and 2 men on the verge of death . 
The best news of the day ! 
--------------------
--------------------
When I killed the albino , no . 
We take care of that arm ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You disgust me . 
She was very beautiful . 
--------------------
--------------------
They fear spending and get married ! 
It is good food ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Fanatic miserable ! 
Miracle ... ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Not my fault if all the money remains you and me all stink ! 
You like long tongue , Caleb ! 
--------------------
--------------------
My wine is better by the day , and in spite of my anger . 
My life is blessed God ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Even the things stolen , I senzaþie a freak . 
If you want to make me happy , you to give them out on my back . 
--------------------
--------------------
He died of illness , was still young . 
You see what looks nice ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Stupid , you frumo and eyes ! 
Always laughing ... ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Do not you want to do no harm ! 
Do not worry ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- And death .... ! 
I wanted to save work to offer . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Nobody has complained so far in May . 
- Of course , everything is free ... ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You started to cry ? 
Do not cry ! 
--------------------
--------------------
The only thing left is this lousy wallet . 
Take it as a gift . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Can 't you just steal ? 
- I’ m not a thief . 
--------------------
--------------------
Not bad . 
With a Porsche it would be better . 
--------------------
--------------------
You see only enemies and obstacles . 
No happiness , no peace , no Iove ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You want to fuck , eh ? 
That 's nice . 
--------------------
--------------------
We 'll fuck Natasha ! 
Ifwe both beg her enough we 'll get it for free ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Not bad . 
I think you 're a wonderful woman . 
--------------------
--------------------
Why are you lying again ? 
You used to be a Rolex hand model . 
--------------------
--------------------
But I don 't want that because it will Iook Iike shit . 
And the hacked- off hand will not Iook Iike shit ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You are dead here , mate . 
These are all my friends . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'd Iike to direct your attention to that slut over there ! 
We had the same professor , and she blew him for a better grade . 
--------------------
--------------------
And if my wife fucks for money , then she is working . 
That 's OK . 
--------------------
--------------------
- I am a full fuck . 
I am happy to hear that . 
--------------------
--------------------
Hey , fellas , remember when we gave those two bitches a Iift ? 
They went to that Goa party . 
--------------------
--------------------
You sound Iike an idiot . 
- Hey , handsome . 
--------------------
--------------------
Where the hell is your brain ? 
Sharing your scrotum with your balls ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You stink ! 
- What a nice flat , Klies . 
--------------------
--------------------
- What the hell , fatty . 
- We are rich . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Mad Dog ! 
- Yes , sir , general . 
--------------------
--------------------
A Ranger was a motherfucker . 
A Ranger was a brave soldier . 
--------------------
--------------------
Mad Dog ! 
Yes , general . 
--------------------
--------------------
The girl will help us kill the fucking Dogo president . 
We 'll get peace in our country . 
--------------------
--------------------
- You ready to fight the war with me ? 
- Yes , sir ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- Death dealers , you listening ? 
- Yes , sir ! 
--------------------
--------------------
This war is our war . 
Free your heart . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fight the war as a soldier . 
Relax your mind . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Mad Dog ! 
- Yes , general ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Nasty ! 
Go clean the pig . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Who the fuck are you ? 
I enjoy myself . 
--------------------
--------------------
Now you 're scared . 
I thought you were brave . 
--------------------
--------------------
I am here to arrest you ! 
Sir , would you be kind enough to play us another tune ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I fear this may be the last day of our school . 
My honourable guest , whose calligraphy do you seek ? 
--------------------
--------------------
And the reason they became enemies was because they were jealous ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
If you died , how could I live ? 
Promise me you will live well when I have gone . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Broken Sword said that ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Does Qin intend to destroy Zhao ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Is the King of Qin an enemy of Zhao ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
She had vowed to avenge her father 's death . 
I wanted to help her . 
--------------------
--------------------
The desire to kill no longer exists . 
Only peace remains . 
--------------------
--------------------
" rejecting that which is bad , 
" preserving and adding up all that is good ,

--------------------
He 's not the smartest guy , he 's not the best- looking guy . 
How do they know he 's the nicest ? 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's the meaning of the phrase " selfish gene " . 
OK , so how can selfish genes support kindness ? 
--------------------
--------------------
' I hate social Darwinism too , 
' but that doesn 't mean we should romanticise nature 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's also , alas , one of the most controversial . 
Science now has the evidence that proves evolution is true . 
--------------------
--------------------
You , sir , are an absolute ass . 
" Your feigned intelligence is nothing more 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's not perfect ! 
It 's the perfect example of ... of why the body is not designed . 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's lousy . 
Our bodies are so fabulous in some respects . 
--------------------
--------------------
Some people find that thought disturbing , even frightening . 
Like Darwin , I find the reality thrilling . 
--------------------
--------------------
You the poor kid that never got to go to Exeter or Andover ? 
Despite my privileged upbringing , 
--------------------
--------------------
Poor bastards . 
Now , have a nice day at school . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Not a problem . 
- Thank you so much ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Everybody 's haunted by their past . 
Well , good- bye . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'll ring her . in an awful lot of trouble . 
Thanks , Professor . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fake . 
For the posh party at the weekend . 
--------------------
--------------------
The Bleeding Heart sisters of eternal misery . 
Interesting date . 
--------------------
--------------------
Two of our former colleagues now live in bloody Moscow . 
Let 's hope they don 't have another bidder . 
--------------------
--------------------
Going anywhere else would be a death sentence . 
You better hope she does , Everett . 
--------------------
--------------------
Makes us all look stupid . 
Yeah , well ... 
--------------------
--------------------
This robbery 's pissed off some local villains . 
The guts come with the glory , eh ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm sorry I 've caused you this upset , Wendy . 
Well , apparently we 're rich . 
--------------------
--------------------
I do something wrong ? 
- You perfectly know . 
--------------------
--------------------
We though not Paris , but welcome to our hut ! 
- Yes , not from Paris , I ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- What are themselves or will plead guilty further deny ? 
- Good ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- He is in danger ! 
- Who is not in danger ? 
--------------------
--------------------
This is the devil knows what ! 
Ha ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You were deceived . 
You are given a much better fur ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Instead of crying , maybe You would go to the sauna ? 
See what you like ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- In any case , not " God Save the Tsar " . 
Dear Comrades , let us rally considered open ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I ventured to disturb you . 
Ready not stingy and pay whatever . 
--------------------
--------------------
Kish , damn you soul ! 
Brilliant combination of brilliantly held until the end . 
--------------------
--------------------
After your whole puking episode ? 
I feel a lot better ... 
--------------------
--------------------
Stand back ... and fire ! 
That 's good ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Untie the fucking gun . 
B21 in human hand . 
--------------------
--------------------
He just hurt his arm , dad . 
The doctors are trying , sweetheart . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fuck off ! 
We all thought it was for the best because he needed help . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's useless to us dead . 
- Would you relax ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Fuck ! 
I thought you said not to kill them ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Control , we 're taking enemy fire ! 
We need support . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fighting MNU security forces , this armed faction is doomed ... 
Now I 'm gonna eat , my friend . 
--------------------
--------------------
I warned you what would happen if you get all dirty again ... 
One , two , three , a winner ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm sorry you 're sick ... 
Thanks ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- Who the hell is this ? 
- A friend of mine . 
--------------------
--------------------
You hurt yourself ! 
That I don 't care ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I was scared the living a light out of me ! 
Oh , and we are amused , aren 't we ! 
--------------------
--------------------
And then , they will take you and kill you . 
Protected Zone . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fuck ! 
I thought you said not to kill them ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- Bad news ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's insulting you ! 
I 'm not insulting you ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- Don 't misbehave at school ! 
- I won 't . 
--------------------
--------------------
This is all very sweet to me , but also a little cruel . 
Who is this Uncle Henri that Pierre seems so fond of ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I didn 't go to all this trouble for nothing . 
- Isn 't it nice here ? 
--------------------
--------------------
So what 's wrong ? 
- Your 35 grand and the Canadian - Yes ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I 've punished others besides you ! 
Don 't look at me like that ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'll find out if you were cheating me . 
Be ready tomorrow night , and you better shape up ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't be scared . 
You have to be brave in life . 
--------------------
--------------------
Yes , I know , but one child is more difficult . 
- It won 't be for very long . 
--------------------
--------------------
Besides , everybody lies , and for lesser things . 
I don 't have the strength . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm just going through a bad phase . 
And there 's someone that 's been supporting you . . 
--------------------
--------------------
I hate being embarrassed . 
Your goodness makes me realise it . 
--------------------
--------------------
I am very poor ; I am unemployed . 
Love me only after I become capable of staying in this mansion . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't you want to weep ? 
Don 't you wish to laugh ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I am defeated by my own self . 
Love me . 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's why I stole your fear . 
You want to smile . 
--------------------
--------------------
I thought you would make me weaker . 
But you 've become my strength , Sanjay . 
--------------------
--------------------
Hello , he 's killed my husband . 
Please help me . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's nonsense . 
Just being a friend . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're scary when you 're mad . 
I won 't do it again . 
--------------------
--------------------
Because you 're tired and your leg 's hurt . 
It won 't happen again . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm almost there , No , you 're tired . 
Okay , okay . 
--------------------
--------------------
- You 're bad . 
I 'm very good to him . 
--------------------
--------------------
You think I 'm stupid ? 
He 's just a friend who gave me a lift . 
--------------------
--------------------
- It 's my first time , will it hurt ? 
- I 'll be gentle . 
--------------------
--------------------
Do you think I would cheat ? 
You 're good at it . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Don 't worry . 
Thanks . 
--------------------
--------------------
I hate the water ! 
Do you ... have a lover ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Now don 't scream ! 
I sang your praises . 
--------------------
--------------------
I felt guilty because you 'd left . 
He said you were a great girl ... 
--------------------
--------------------
But that girl can be so possessive ... no way to get rid of her . 
But I think she 's really fond of you . 
--------------------
--------------------
It upset my plans , which were upset anyway . 
He backed off , and I missed a great chance ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't talk nonsense ! 
OK , let 's talk about Lea ! 
--------------------
--------------------
This your revenge ? 
Certainly not ! 
--------------------
--------------------
We 're not in love . 
You love someone else . 
--------------------
--------------------
But I was stupid . 
I love Fabien . 
--------------------
--------------------
lf ever you know anything awkward , I forbid you to tell me . 
For now , we 're euphoric . 
--------------------
--------------------
I broke up with Fabien ! 
This time it 's for good . 
--------------------
--------------------
It can be a disadvantage . 
They seek me out , so I just relax . 
--------------------
--------------------
And when we stop doing it , we 'll be dead . 
Brought to you by WlTH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm really feeling bad lately . 
Thank you ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Didn 't you catch a robber at that time ? 
Didn 't you get a thank- you gift ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , the robber . 
I 'm not a robber . 
--------------------
--------------------
I was the one who caught the robber . 
Yes , the scooter . 
--------------------
--------------------
Being lead down an annoying path . 
I honestly don 't know where this is going . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's a fake thing . 
There 's no unconditional love . 
--------------------
--------------------
I am scared . 
You got , like , this perfect life . 
--------------------
--------------------
So she 's gonna kill it . 
Well , it does seem cleaner . 
--------------------
--------------------
Something inside of me didn 't think it was wrong . 
It 's like a dream . 
--------------------
--------------------
Damn it . 
I was hoping you weren 't going to ask her that . 
--------------------
--------------------
Why the hell would you say they were ? 
To make them happy . 
--------------------
--------------------
Why their place had no music , no view , no decor . 
- But if you can 't feel pleasure , what 's with the cocaine ? 
--------------------
--------------------
but she could get stressed by daddy dying . 
You don 't know if we 'll get better ? 
--------------------
--------------------
If he doesn 't have fmf , the colchicine will kill him . 
Boy , sure hope I 'm right . 
--------------------
--------------------
I don 't -- I don 't want to be a loser . 
You 're not a loser . 
--------------------
--------------------
with hormones , and emotion , and fear , and ... 
You just can 't make a huge decision like this right now . 
--------------------
--------------------
* It worries me sometimes * 
* That I want love * 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's too bad . 
You would 've made a great mother . 
--------------------
--------------------
you told me I 'd suck as a mother . 
Now that I 've lost it , you tell me I 'd be great as a mother . 
--------------------
--------------------
My problem is that it 's a bad idea 
To mix business and pleasure . 
--------------------
--------------------
What a hurtful thing to say , 
Especially given how generous I 've been to your family . 
--------------------
--------------------
No problem . 
I love you . 
--------------------
--------------------
To behave in reckless ways . 
And when the pursuit of our heart 's desire 
--------------------
--------------------
No bad influences , right ? 
You take care of him , Cecil . 
--------------------
--------------------
You fucking shit yourself . 
- Anyway , look , good to see you , boys . 
--------------------
--------------------
Suck his cock . 
Enjoy that , did you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's my first night , for fuck 's sake . 
Remember , Cass , you can 't trust none of them , mate . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fucking cunt ! 
Look , just look fucking smart , all right ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You bastard . 
I 'm always fucking smart . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Are you keeping out of trouble , though ? 
- I 've always been a good boy , Mum . 
--------------------
--------------------
Jealous cunt . 
But what they forget is the pleasure of it . 
--------------------
--------------------
Pure as the driven snow , that shit you done . 
After all , we 're not fucking stupid . 
--------------------
--------------------
When this hard cunt comes in . 
Obviously fucking fancied himself like . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Who the fuck are you ? 
- Oh , Lizzy , you 've been so good to me . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Trouble is coming - Temptation 
- It 's just the high cost of loving - Temptation 
--------------------
--------------------
A little bit crazy , a little bit bad . 
But , hey , don 't us girls just love that ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- It 's no problem for me either . 
- I 'd rather take care of it myself . 
--------------------
--------------------
I thought I was gonna lose you there . 
You 're nothin ' but trouble to me , but I still love you . 
--------------------

We won 't lie down . 
--------------------
--------------------
We 've got to destroy this as soon as possible . 
It won 't change anything . 
--------------------
--------------------
A society that hates this war . 
And which wishes peace and freedom for everybody .

Don 't you worry about her . 
She 's a very good friend of mine .

--------------------
--------------------
See how they cry . 
How beautiful ! 
--------------------
--------------------
What if the lions are less cruel than you ? 
What if someday he comes back to bring the peace ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You can 't understand your cruelty . 
Because you don 't know what love is . 
--------------------
--------------------
And now you 're here , hurt , with no force left to fight ... 
For Love ! 
--------------------

We will kill her . 
Because he loves only me .

And your eyes turned bad ... ... and ugly . 
You 're lucky that I can 't move . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Do it , Idiot . 
Look , Look , he 's alive ! 
--------------------
--------------------
She and her people have suffered a lot . 
It is easy to be good when you 're happy . 
--------------------
--------------------
- And you unleashed all this ruin . 
To make justice . 
--------------------
--------------------
Bastard ! 
All you think of is laughter and booze . 
--------------------
--------------------
And tell all that the King fears nothing ! 
Because the tournament champion is with him . 
--------------------
--------------------
What is this nonsense ! 
Because of people like you today Muslims ' plight is like this ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Mullah sir has harassed the foreigners a lot . 
Television has made my work easy . 
--------------------
--------------------
Like telling lies is forbidden .

I just don 't feel like going ! 
--------------------
--------------------
But I have no complains now . 
Now I can proudly say that I 've the best father in the world ! 
--------------------
--------------------
This is deceiving ! 
But my dear he is a fair foreigner . 
--------------------
--------------------
All went waste . 
- Yes , true . 
--------------------
--------------------
He is one of those terrorists . 
Why is he enjoying his life with you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
The prosecution lawyer may proceed . 
I 'll tell the truth , nothing but the truth . 
--------------------
--------------------
O coward ! 
O honor- less ! 
--------------------
--------------------
But there is something I regret . 
I have not given you any happiness in life . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'd hate to see that happen . 
Which is why I will certainly join you for lunch today . 
--------------------
--------------------
I ' m going to be broke ! 
This is the tax you pay for the fun you have , Bhandari ! 
--------------------
--------------------
But you must fix my problem first . 
- Make me a great betel- leaf .

--------------------
But this is nothing ... ... the war is yet to begin . 
So bless me , mother ...

He unleashed a storm on poor Geeta ! 
Yes ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- You ' re hurt ! 
- Yes ... ... it must 've peeled my hand when I lifted the car . 
--------------------
--------------------
No man can ever live only on hatred and malice . 
You could have tried asking someone for her love and affection ... 
--------------------
--------------------
I can 't understand any of your nonsense ! 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't sulk , no need to be jealous . 
Here 's a little bonus . 
--------------------
--------------------
Your nose isn 't bloody radar ! 
It 's a 'state of grace ' . 
--------------------
--------------------
Wouldn 't you be sad , Monique ? 
Go ahead and laugh ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- Dirty old poof ! 
- Easy does it , boys ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't be so damn nasty , Antoine ! 
Bob 's a wonderful friend . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 'll hurt his feelings . 
Forget it sweetheart , it 's OK . 
--------------------
--------------------
Poor people ... they risk their freedom to steal our boredom . 
We have a lot of fun , really . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 'll be alone with your shame . 
But I 'll turn it to happiness ... a bouquet of flowers . 
--------------------
--------------------
- You really are a slut . 
- That 's why we get on so well . 
--------------------
--------------------
I was sad ... 
I needed affection ... 
--------------------
--------------------
Of what was stolen from me ... 
I 'll give you back your dreams ... 
--------------------
--------------------
- Cut the crap , it 's no time ... 
Relax , I 'll take a look . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Bob , you bastard !

Too bad .

Goddamn it , John ! 
We hunted our own kind , Logan .

Large blind 's a hundred , small blind 's fifty . 
May I give you a hand ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Shoot on sight ! 
I can help . 
--------------------
--------------------
Where the hell am I ? 
Listen , I am a friend . 
--------------------
--------------------
Emptiness . 
Warmth . 
--------------------
--------------------
The government will lose this time . 
Or so I hope . 
--------------------
--------------------
Where the hell are they ? 
Do you often fall in love ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I swear , I have had it with that goddamn kid . 
- He won 't even answer me anymore . 
--------------------
--------------------
I wouldn 't worry about him . 
Thanks for your cooperation . 
--------------------
--------------------
Negative . 
The T- 1000 would definitely try to reacquire you there . 
--------------------
--------------------
Something 's wrong . 
She 's never this nice . 
--------------------
--------------------
I hated her for that . 
But everything she said was true .

--------------------
What 's your problem ? 
Help ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- Did you call moi a dipshit ? 
- Just trying to help this punk . 
--------------------
--------------------
John , it was stupid of you to go there . 
You have to be smarter than that . 
--------------------
--------------------
The data could be called " pain " . 
John , help me with the light . 
--------------------
--------------------
Chill out , dick- wad . 
That 's great . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Skynet fights back . 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Why attack Russia ? 
Aren 't they our friends now ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Killing Dyson might prevent the war . 
I don 't care ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , shit . 
Not good . 
--------------------
--------------------
Shit ! 
She 's in the clean room . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fuck you . 
Help ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Earth is under attack . 
And it is glorious ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You killed my older brother . 
So , why did you help us ? 
--------------------
--------------------
What the hell have you done to yourself this time ? 
Cybernetic strength- enhancers . 
--------------------
--------------------
Damn it ! 
I can 't get you free Jax . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 've seen worse , too . 
If you are Nightwolf , you know I won Mortal Kombat . 
--------------------
--------------------
Without Rayden , it 's hopeless . 
Never give up hope . 
--------------------
--------------------
They 're your weakness . 
Oh , well thanks for the tip . 
--------------------
--------------------
Pathetic and weak . 
Clearly Rayden has molded you in his image . 
--------------------
--------------------
Without your weapons ... you are no match for Motaro . 
Jax , help ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I suppose I 'll die . 
Or maybe you 'd save me , 
--------------------
--------------------
I feel fear , anxiety , isolation and darkness . 
Sometimes I feel hope ... ... 
--------------------
--------------------
Even if we merge , what 's going to happen when i die ? 
My genes won 't remain even as copies . 
--------------------
--------------------
I don 't give a shit about that . 
He doesn 't care about them . 
--------------------
--------------------
In the worst case . 
I 'd like to tell you , that I respect you . 
--------------------
--------------------
Could it explode by accident ? 
Dear Nina ! 
--------------------
--------------------
They covered his face as if he were dead . 
Nobody would have survived such an explosion . 
--------------------
--------------------
The bomb exploded two metres away from him . 
He can 't have survived . 
--------------------
--------------------
Or you 're a dead man ! 
I thought you were more clever , Stauffenberg . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm terribly saddened ... 
I was just informed , that our beloved Fuhrer 
--------------------
--------------------
Every day brings more losses ; new disasters . 
The only thing we want is a permanent peace . 
--------------------
--------------------
That man 's hatred ... is unpredictable . 
We won 't lie down . 
--------------------
--------------------
We 've got to destroy this as soon as possible . 
It won 't change anything . 
--------------------
--------------------
A society that hates the war . 
And wishes peace and freedom for everybody . 
--------------------
--------------------
Is there no one here who could put an end to his suffering ? 
Pridun , take care of this . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're in danger ? 
OK , I 'm coming . 
--------------------
--------------------
She would suffer too much . 
Satisfied ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- A crime ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'II give the signaI to attack . 
Take care of her . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 'II get fuck- aIl . 
Like heIl ! 
--------------------
--------------------
May the mercifuI Lord punish me ! 
May I have no joy in this Iife ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You know yourself that they 're honest people , but poor . 
Honest , you say ! 
--------------------
--------------------
May eviI and violence disappear . 
May honesty and nobleness win . 
--------------------
--------------------
Robbers and murderers play sabbath in front of the whole world . 
Throwing their hats up in the heavens , as the saying goes . 
--------------------
--------------------
We 'II be doing so weII now that even Saakadze gets jealous . 
I didn 't come here for you making fun of me . 
--------------------
--------------------
ShaII we attack them ? 
No , they invite us in good faith . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't think I 'm blaming you . 
On the contrary , I feeI a strange desire to help you . 
--------------------
--------------------
And if one day we 're in trouble ... 
I 'II be happy to do for you what I can . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're a stupid boy . 
Why do you care for sweets ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Woe to you , and a buIlet in the head . 
Please don 't kiII me , my dears . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't you hurt this boy , you got me ? 
I 'II never hurt him , Ilo , my dear , only don 't kiII me . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Careful , you devil ! 
- Take it easy , Ilo . 
--------------------
--------------------
We must attack the prison . 
And free Simon . 
--------------------
--------------------
It is my burden and mine alone . 
- I 'll be repaying the favor very soon . 
--------------------
--------------------
Angela , for example , will die dead . 
[ Laughing ] 
--------------------
--------------------
You lose . 
Your wedding better watch it . 
--------------------
--------------------
I gotta say I 'm not loving it . 
No , but you were both so good . 
--------------------
--------------------
You just ruined our wedding . 
You happy now ? 
--------------------
--------------------
'Cause she 's a bad influence on you , and she always has been . 
Judging by that DVD , you 're a lot more like her than I thought . 
--------------------
--------------------
How painful it would be to run into one . 
I wonder if I 'll ever be free again . 
--------------------
--------------------
And that Satan will try to discourage you . 
Do you trust in god ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Watch out fag . 
Did you tell your friends ? 
--------------------
--------------------
When I was miserable ? 
That looked like I was getting better ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Why would I choose to have my entire family hate me ? 
No we love you . 
--------------------
--------------------
I killed my son ! 
You did not kill your son . 
--------------------
--------------------
Bobby killed himself . 
How could God forgive me ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Why are we wasting it on this ? 
Alright , alright . 
--------------------
--------------------
Cease fire ! 
Woo , Scott , follow me ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Kill me ! 
I don 't care . 
--------------------
--------------------
My brothers , we must not see only the threat . 
I have longed for this opportunity . 
--------------------
--------------------
All the same , it will be dangerous . 
Promise me ... you 'll be careful . 
--------------------
--------------------
Then why have you taken to this dishonorable life of stealing ? 
Well , you know as well as I do , Father . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no . 
Have you ever heard of the great King David ? 
--------------------
--------------------
No right , Bishop Courtenay , no right ? 
The Queen Mother has spoken and we shall listen respectfully . 
--------------------
--------------------
There is danger for you here . 
In Prague you would be honored , as you deserve . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'll run but you 're in trouble if you 're late . 
We won 't , I 'll put these in water . 
--------------------
--------------------
- The sinful . 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
What can you explain , bastard ? ! 
- Sweetie ! 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's wrong with you ? ! 
You relax ! 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's wrong ? 
You can 't trust them . 
--------------------
--------------------
This sucks ! 
I 'm her best friend and I don 't know her twin ! 
--------------------
--------------------
What else can one steal here ? 
It 's either the splendour of nature or the chill of ice 
--------------------
--------------------
Deepak sir ... the enemy will now lie in coffins 
Let 's hope so 
--------------------
--------------------
0 And the idiot didn 't even try to get in touch with us 
I hope the patrol party is okay ! 
--------------------
--------------------
There 's said to be some problem there 
That 's nice . 
--------------------
--------------------
I will avenge every death ! 
Right now I 'm not thinking of revenge . 
--------------------
--------------------
The worst of illiterates turn poets 
Praised be Krishna . 
--------------------
--------------------
To seek and destroy . 
- Yes , sir 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're dead right 
Too wise for your age 
--------------------
--------------------
The enemy can 't be seen . 
We can 't assess their strength either 
--------------------
--------------------
I believe the situation is very bad . 
- Yes , sir . 
--------------------
--------------------
May evil be vanquished ! 
May there be compassion 
--------------------
--------------------
Look Sachin , it 's as dangerous for me as it is for you 
Just relax . 
--------------------
--------------------
Bastards ! 
I don 't care , Balwan 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry , Colonel . 
Victory and glory will be ours 
--------------------
--------------------
- Don 't worry about me , Ma 
You take care of yourself 
--------------------
--------------------
You are not happy ? 
Happy about what , sir ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Colonel Ravi , this is the turning point of the war 
You and your boys have done a great job 
--------------------
--------------------
I don 't want to die . 
Save me 
--------------------
--------------------
And what if we lose ? 
Some goals are so worthy , it 's glorious even to feel 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't lose anything . 
And yes ... 
--------------------
--------------------
There 's a price to be paid for every victory in war 
I just lost dear friend . 
--------------------
--------------------
All you must think of is the enemy ! 
- Yes , sir 
--------------------
--------------------
- But you attacked them , didn 't you ? 
God bless our JCO Zakeer Husain who suggested the idea 
--------------------
--------------------
One gun fire 
Good shot , brother . 
--------------------
--------------------
Death is staring him in the face and he 's thinking of his girl ! 
Yes , sir . 
--------------------
--------------------
The bastards are sending for reinforcements ! 
I 'll go and fetch our friends 
--------------------
--------------------
My father can 't be wrong 
I 'm not going to die . 
--------------------
--------------------
Bastard 
I won 't spare them ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Bastards ! 
I won 't spare anyone ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You can launch an attack on Khalubar now 
God bless the soldier 
--------------------
--------------------
" that you will complain no more " 
" The ones you love ... " 
--------------------
--------------------
No problems at all . 
Safe to say there was nothing left to hit the fan . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry . 
It 's perfectly normal . 
--------------------
--------------------
We even had some trouble finding your records . 
But as we gastroenterologists are very fond of saying : 
--------------------
--------------------
What the fuck ? 
Thanks . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no , no , just a second . 
This is so cool . 
--------------------
--------------------
That is more than all the casualties from all the wars fought ... 
- ... in the history of the United States . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm gonna lose my job . 
You 'll get a better one . 
--------------------
--------------------
I assume that Mr. Grieves got the colonoscopy . 
- Yes , actually -- - I wasn 't fucking talking to you . 
--------------------
--------------------
Mr. Grieves ' procedure was complicated by the fact that -- 
The fact that he wasn 't clean , he wasn 't prepared ? 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's wrong with my leg ? 
You 've tested positive for a group- A streptococcal infection . 
--------------------
--------------------
What the fuck were you thinking ? 
Hi , sweetheart . 
--------------------
--------------------
Not bad . 
Yeah sure . 
--------------------
--------------------
Too bad we 're just colleagues . 
Pretty busy up here . 
--------------------
--------------------
I say let 's be reckless 
Rather than feckless What good is that ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- Our car broke down . 
Your friend okay ? . 
--------------------
--------------------
# Left for dead # 
# Left for good # 
--------------------
--------------------
Do you want to know what happens when you die ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
# So stay and spin and fail and fail # 
# Who 'll ever win # 
--------------------
--------------------
That dress is such a paiN . 
Right ? >> Yes . >> If you want to vote for melinda : 
--------------------
--------------------
little boy , huh ? >> NO . 
I have a lot of respect for diana ross . 
--------------------
--------------------
It wasn 't terrible . 
It wasn 't fantastic . 
--------------------
--------------------
It was really , really weak . 
You know what i love about you . ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Sorry . >> Wrong choice of song for me . 
I don 't feel this was your best performance . >> ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I ain 't spending no more time wasted 
( cheers and applause ) 
--------------------
--------------------
>> Going to hollywood ! >> I just want to make it really bad . 
>> You ready for the truth ? 
--------------------
--------------------
We hate to see them go . 
We have a great show to help ease the pain . 
--------------------
--------------------
You sang " trouble . " 
Randy loved your big voicE . 
--------------------
--------------------
You know, that was the problem . 
You are not a bad singer, actually . 
--------------------
--------------------
Simon thought it was weak and weird and lacked impact . 
A. J. , You sang " feeling good . " 
--------------------
--------------------
But the myth ignores the squalid reality of violent death . 
The western hero has simple religious beliefs . 
--------------------
--------------------
And the next day I go out and I steal double . 
And then I feel happy . 
--------------------
--------------------
He is , to all intents and purposes , dead long before that . 
The ones that I 've witnessed were very easy . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Wrong guy . 
Yes ? 
--------------------
--------------------
We 've run out of the crude planks . 
It 's clean now . 
--------------------
--------------------
People are living in poverty and misery . 
Although with all those pesos we could build a better society . 
--------------------
--------------------
Moses needed to be killed . 
And only one interested will be soon six feet under . 
--------------------
--------------------
This is an outrage ! 
I made it quite clear , DI Drake - either with me or against me . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're miserable ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Bon voyage , scumbag . 
Well , I hope you 're all proud of yourselves . 
--------------------
--------------------
When I got back here , she was crying . 
You 're going to have to be really strong for her . 
--------------------
--------------------
Mr Drake was quite badly hurt . 
He 's a lovely man . 
--------------------
--------------------
I shouldn 't be scared ? 
Well , I had to make sure you were the person I was looking for . 
--------------------
--------------------
I felt so bad for them . 
But not bad enough that you couldn 't come to us ? 
--------------------
--------------------
We catch criminals . 
It 's what we do best . 
--------------------
--------------------
No problem , ma 'am . 
Have a good night . 
--------------------
--------------------
You jealous ? 
Don 't flatter yourself , sweetheart . 
--------------------
--------------------
I haven 't got much bloody choice , have I ? 
You 're not such a bad copper , you know . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're assaulting me ! 
As if it 's that easy ... 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm broke . 
Do you accept credit cards ? 
--------------------
--------------------
No , there 's no place for you to try it on . 
This is my favorite shade of blue . 
--------------------
--------------------
Are you scared we 'll be busted ? 
" A handsome shop owner " . 
--------------------
--------------------
Are you scared of living a poor life ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
The son- of- a- bitch ! 
That 's even better . 
--------------------
--------------------
Excuse my saying so but I think this is stupidity . 
You know best . 
--------------------
--------------------
Considering a couch an investment proves you 're a bad tradesman . 
What 's a good tradesman doing here ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm tired . 
But we had a lot of fun . 
--------------------
--------------------
I didn 't say it was dishonest , honey ! 
Can anybody be as honest as you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're not very cheerful either . 
Look Selim , I hope you 're not worried about this . 
--------------------
--------------------
You went to a lot of trouble . 
Thanks a lot Selim . 
--------------------
--------------------
I want to say something , but don 't get mad . 
Just so I 'll feel confident . 
--------------------
--------------------
Is anyone scared ? 
I 'm very happy . 
--------------------
--------------------
I swear we sell them for the price of dead sheep . 
Well , good- bye now . 
--------------------
--------------------
And no harm is done to the historical object . 
It may be against the law but it 's not a sin . 
--------------------
--------------------
Terribly hot . 
I love this , look . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's not something to be sad about ... 
Why aren 't you glad ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Go , get the weapons . 
Don 't trust nobody , only your family . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fuck ! 
Good Evening . 
--------------------
--------------------
Mom ... ... and if they kill you , what should I do ? 
That won 't happen . 
--------------------
--------------------
Because they weren 't bad off . 
They were winning . 
--------------------
--------------------
386 00 : 22 : 29, 191 -- > 00 : 22 : 31, 182 When to kazes , how ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
I mean , I know that is in distress . 
That 's why I requested you to help me . 
--------------------
--------------------
1281 01 : 19 : 04, 182 -- > 01 : 19 : 07, 288 All will be fine . 
- Good . 
--------------------
--------------------
Are you scared ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
He was deceived . 
He 's very kind . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't shoot ! 
Take them alive ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- This war confused my plans . 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Prisoners ! 
I 'm not wrong ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Almost all of you will die . 
And that will be good . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 'll all be killed . 
lf you want to stay alive , I 'll get you out . 
--------------------
--------------------
You scare off the customers . 
It would benefit everyone if you left Bente . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's destroying you . 
The union won 't like you forcing me to leave my wife . 
--------------------
--------------------
But to act on it is wrong . 
Put distance between the heart and the hand . 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's gonna hurt tomorrow . 
- Yup , I nailed him good . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't ever fucking threaten me . 
And you better lay off hitting Bente . 
--------------------
--------------------
Rules are made to be broken . 
Alf said a clever thing . 
--------------------
--------------------
L 'll lose my voice before opening night . 
And you showing up , doesn 't help . 
--------------------
--------------------
You have always been a little crazy - but it seems to be worse . 
You need help . 
--------------------
--------------------
Come on , it 's not that great . 
- Yes , it is . 
--------------------
--------------------
Nobody panics . 
They 're good . 
--------------------
--------------------
- It 's not good enough ! 
Not good enough ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Twice as useless ! 
- Yes , yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
- No one envies us any more . 
- I 'm smart ! 
--------------------
--------------------
He wants to kill everybody ? 
Great ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Killing ! 
He can 't enjoy it . 
--------------------
--------------------
This is really cruel , Oskar . 
You are giving them hope . 
--------------------
--------------------
Nothing bad is going to happen to you there . 
You 'll receive special treatment . 
--------------------
--------------------
Where 's the scam ? 
It 's good business . 
--------------------
--------------------
I could have you arrested . 
I 'm protected by powerful friends . 
--------------------
--------------------
I am a criminal . 
At midnight you 'll be free , and I 'll be hunted . 
--------------------
--------------------
She didn 't kill anyone ! 
Funny . 
--------------------
--------------------
We 've got no visitations , no phone calls . 
It 's clean . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Don 't worry , I think I 've got a plan . 
But we 're gonna need some help from an old friend . 
--------------------
--------------------
This is not my first time inside a prison . 
But hopefully ... 
--------------------
--------------------
Fearfully blazing 
He gave a great yawn 
--------------------
--------------------
And he suffers from palsy That makes his paws shake 
Yet he was in his youth Quite the smartest of cats 
--------------------
--------------------
And I once understudied Dick Whittington 's Cat 
But my grandest creation 
--------------------
--------------------
But when a crime 's discovered Then Macavity 's not there 
He 's outwardly respectable 
--------------------
--------------------
No problem , Mr. Peterson . 
Enjoy your stay . 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , shit . 
Yes ! 
--------------------
--------------------
What the fuck are you doing here ? 
I don 't care what this guy did , all right ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Someone 's still hurting from a bad break- up . 
Beautiful and wise . 
--------------------
--------------------
Trunk line three , negative lock . 
Transit trunk node Bravo four is active . 
--------------------
--------------------
Negative lockout . 
Intel set tracer active . 
--------------------
--------------------
Negative lockout . 
Target SlM just went active . 
--------------------
--------------------
And this only failed by one vote . 
I bet the folks back in Omaha are glad that didn 't pass . 
--------------------
--------------------
Your seatbelt 's broken . 
It won 't fasten . 
--------------------
--------------------
They think something wrong . 
Welcome to Moscow . 
--------------------
--------------------
Echelon knew flight 4400 would crash . 
Yes , with probability of 94 . 67 % . 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , shit . 
All right , on yourfeet , Grant ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Listen to people who hurt you . 
- Listen to Muhammad - Muhammad is generous itself . 
--------------------
--------------------
Your prophet is a fraud , Kill him ! 
- Protect the Prophet Protéjanlo of the guards ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- Only weaker left - Ruin our reputation . 
We are honest traders . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm not afraid of what lies ahead of me . 
Glory to Hubal ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- If ... but you were the most bitter sword against Islam . 
Now , by God 's ... adjourn the top is a sword in his name . 
--------------------
--------------------
( whines ) 
It 'll do you a lot of good . 
--------------------
--------------------
Hell of a life bein ' a mountie , ain 't it , kid ? 
Yeah , great . 
--------------------
--------------------
Goddamn ! 
Help me , somebody ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Jimmy Tom is dead ! 
I 'll take care of it . 
--------------------
--------------------
Jimmy Tom is dead ! 
I told you I would take care of it . 
--------------------
--------------------
The dead body over there ... ... probably has your bullet in him . 
I have a pretty fair idea what happened out here . 
--------------------
--------------------
Hell of a way for a man to die - being blown up . 
Yeah - be a good man to have on your side . 
--------------------
--------------------
As long as there 's a war going on , you 're my responsibility . 
I can take care of myself . 
--------------------
--------------------
Moron . 
Funny . 
--------------------
--------------------
Shit ! 
Thank goodness . 
--------------------
--------------------
Who that motherfucker ? 
Great country . 
--------------------
--------------------
People don 't get soft in prison . 
Pretty good . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's got a bad attitude . 
Who 's your friend ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You ain 't the only one that knows some shit . 
Good job , my man . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Damn , that was hot . 
- Thanks . 
--------------------
--------------------
What the hell you doing ? ! 
I hope you land on your feet , grasshopper . 
--------------------
--------------------
Such an ugly word . 
Encouraging ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- Shit ! 
This just got interesting . 
--------------------
--------------------
Yeah , prison food tastes like shit . 
Yes , it does . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fuck you ! 
Very clever . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's my fault . 
She 's not gonna die , Danny . 
--------------------
--------------------
Sorry , Danny , you lose . 
And now Round 9 is gonna be so much fun . 
--------------------
--------------------
A new form of terrorism threatens us . 
More powerful . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Terrorists ? 
- I think , yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
But one false step would destroy what has taken years to build . 
Power , trust and respect for Africans . 
--------------------
--------------------
It was picked up 17 dead and 2 men on the verge of death . 
The best news of the day ! 
--------------------
--------------------
When I killed the albino , no . 
We take care of that arm ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You disgust me . 
She was very beautiful . 
--------------------
--------------------
They fear spending and get married ! 
It is good food ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Fanatic miserable ! 
Miracle ... ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Not my fault if all the money remains you and me all stink ! 
You like long tongue , Caleb ! 
--------------------
--------------------
My wine is better by the day , and in spite of my anger . 
My life is blessed God ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Even the things stolen , I senzaþie a freak . 
If you want to make me happy , you to give them out on my back . 
--------------------
--------------------
He died of illness , was still young . 
You see what looks nice ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Stupid , you frumo and eyes ! 
Always laughing ... ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Do not you want to do no harm ! 
Do not worry ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- And death .... ! 
I wanted to save work to offer . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Nobody has complained so far in May . 
- Of course , everything is free ... ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You started to cry ? 
Do not cry ! 
--------------------
--------------------
The only thing left is this lousy wallet . 
Take it as a gift . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Can 't you just steal ? 
- I’ m not a thief . 
--------------------
--------------------
Not bad . 
With a Porsche it would be better . 
--------------------
--------------------
You see only enemies and obstacles . 
No happiness , no peace , no Iove ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You want to fuck , eh ? 
That 's nice . 
--------------------
--------------------
We 'll fuck Natasha ! 
Ifwe both beg her enough we 'll get it for free ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Not bad . 
I think you 're a wonderful woman . 
--------------------
--------------------
Why are you lying again ? 
You used to be a Rolex hand model . 
--------------------
--------------------
But I don 't want that because it will Iook Iike shit . 
And the hacked- off hand will not Iook Iike shit ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You are dead here , mate . 
These are all my friends . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'd Iike to direct your attention to that slut over there ! 
We had the same professor , and she blew him for a better grade . 
--------------------
--------------------
And if my wife fucks for money , then she is working . 
That 's OK . 
--------------------
--------------------
- I am a full fuck . 
I am happy to hear that . 
--------------------
--------------------
Hey , fellas , remember when we gave those two bitches a Iift ? 
They went to that Goa party . 
--------------------
--------------------
You sound Iike an idiot . 
- Hey , handsome . 
--------------------
--------------------
Where the hell is your brain ? 
Sharing your scrotum with your balls ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You stink ! 
- What a nice flat , Klies . 
--------------------
--------------------
- What the hell , fatty . 
- We are rich . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Mad Dog ! 
- Yes , sir , general . 
--------------------
--------------------
A Ranger was a motherfucker . 
A Ranger was a brave soldier . 
--------------------
--------------------
Mad Dog ! 
Yes , general . 
--------------------
--------------------
The girl will help us kill the fucking Dogo president . 
We 'll get peace in our country . 
--------------------
--------------------
- You ready to fight the war with me ? 
- Yes , sir ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- Death dealers , you listening ? 
- Yes , sir ! 
--------------------
--------------------
This war is our war . 
Free your heart . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fight the war as a soldier . 
Relax your mind . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Mad Dog ! 
- Yes , general ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Nasty ! 
Go clean the pig . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Who the fuck are you ? 
I enjoy myself . 
--------------------
--------------------
Now you 're scared . 
I thought you were brave . 
--------------------
--------------------
I am here to arrest you ! 
Sir , would you be kind enough to play us another tune ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I fear this may be the last day of our school . 
My honourable guest , whose calligraphy do you seek ? 
--------------------
--------------------
And the reason they became enemies was because they were jealous ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
If you died , how could I live ? 
Promise me you will live well when I have gone . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Broken Sword said that ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Does Qin intend to destroy Zhao ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Is the King of Qin an enemy of Zhao ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
She had vowed to avenge her father 's death . 
I wanted to help her . 
--------------------
--------------------
The desire to kill no longer exists . 
Only peace remains . 
--------------------
--------------------
" rejecting that which is bad , 
" preserving and adding up all that is good , 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's not the smartest guy , he 's not the best- looking guy . 
How do they know he 's the nicest ? 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's the meaning of the phrase " selfish gene " . 
OK , so how can selfish genes support kindness ? 
--------------------
--------------------
' I hate social Darwinism too , 
' but that doesn 't mean we should romanticise nature 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's also , alas , one of the most controversial . 
Science now has the evidence that proves evolution is true . 
--------------------
--------------------
You , sir , are an absolute ass . 
" Your feigned intelligence is nothing more 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's not perfect ! 
It 's the perfect example of ... of why the body is not designed . 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's lousy . 
Our bodies are so fabulous in some respects . 
--------------------
--------------------
Some people find that thought disturbing , even frightening . 
Like Darwin , I find the reality thrilling . 
--------------------
--------------------
You the poor kid that never got to go to Exeter or Andover ? 
Despite my privileged upbringing , 
--------------------
--------------------
Poor bastards . 
Now , have a nice day at school . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Not a problem . 
- Thank you so much ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Everybody 's haunted by their past . 
Well , good- bye . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'll ring her . in an awful lot of trouble . 
Thanks , Professor . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fake . 
For the posh party at the weekend . 
--------------------
--------------------
The Bleeding Heart sisters of eternal misery . 
Interesting date . 
--------------------
--------------------
Two of our former colleagues now live in bloody Moscow . 
Let 's hope they don 't have another bidder . 
--------------------
--------------------
Going anywhere else would be a death sentence . 
You better hope she does , Everett . 
--------------------
--------------------
Makes us all look stupid . 
Yeah , well ... 
--------------------
--------------------
This robbery 's pissed off some local villains . 
The guts come with the glory , eh ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm sorry I 've caused you this upset , Wendy . 
Well , apparently we 're rich . 
--------------------
--------------------
I do something wrong ? 
- You perfectly know . 
--------------------
--------------------
We though not Paris , but welcome to our hut ! 
- Yes , not from Paris , I ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- What are themselves or will plead guilty further deny ? 
- Good ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- He is in danger ! 
- Who is not in danger ? 
--------------------
--------------------
This is the devil knows what ! 
Ha ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You were deceived . 
You are given a much better fur ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Instead of crying , maybe You would go to the sauna ? 
See what you like ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- In any case , not " God Save the Tsar " . 
Dear Comrades , let us rally considered open ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I ventured to disturb you . 
Ready not stingy and pay whatever . 
--------------------
--------------------
Kish , damn you soul ! 
Brilliant combination of brilliantly held until the end . 
--------------------
--------------------
After your whole puking episode ? 
I feel a lot better ... 
--------------------
--------------------
Stand back ... and fire ! 
That 's good ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Untie the fucking gun . 
B21 in human hand . 
--------------------
--------------------
He just hurt his arm , dad . 
The doctors are trying , sweetheart . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fuck off ! 
We all thought it was for the best because he needed help . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's useless to us dead . 
- Would you relax ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Fuck ! 
I thought you said not to kill them ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Control , we 're taking enemy fire ! 
We need support . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fighting MNU security forces , this armed faction is doomed ... 
Now I 'm gonna eat , my friend . 
--------------------
--------------------
I warned you what would happen if you get all dirty again ... 
One , two , three , a winner ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm sorry you 're sick ... 
Thanks ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- Who the hell is this ? 
- A friend of mine . 
--------------------
--------------------
You hurt yourself ! 
That I don 't care ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I was scared the living a light out of me ! 
Oh , and we are amused , aren 't we ! 
--------------------
--------------------
And then , they will take you and kill you . 
Protected Zone . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fuck ! 
I thought you said not to kill them ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- Bad news ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's insulting you ! 
I 'm not insulting you ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- Don 't misbehave at school ! 
- I won 't . 
--------------------
--------------------
This is all very sweet to me , but also a little cruel . 
Who is this Uncle Henri that Pierre seems so fond of ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I didn 't go to all this trouble for nothing . 
- Isn 't it nice here ? 
--------------------
--------------------
So what 's wrong ? 
- Your 35 grand and the Canadian - Yes ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I 've punished others besides you ! 
Don 't look at me like that ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'll find out if you were cheating me . 
Be ready tomorrow night , and you better shape up ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't be scared . 
You have to be brave in life . 
--------------------
--------------------
Yes , I know , but one child is more difficult . 
- It won 't be for very long . 
--------------------
--------------------
Besides , everybody lies , and for lesser things . 
I don 't have the strength . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm just going through a bad phase . 
And there 's someone that 's been supporting you . . 
--------------------
--------------------
I hate being embarrassed . 
Your goodness makes me realise it . 
--------------------
--------------------
I am very poor ; I am unemployed . 
Love me only after I become capable of staying in this mansion . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't you want to weep ? 
Don 't you wish to laugh ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I am defeated by my own self . 
Love me . 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's why I stole your fear . 
You want to smile . 
--------------------
--------------------
I thought you would make me weaker . 
But you 've become my strength , Sanjay . 
--------------------
--------------------
Hello , he 's killed my husband . 
Please help me . 
--------------------
--------------------
And the other who destroy the one who destroyed them . 
It is your bad luck and my good luck . . 
--------------------
--------------------
He damaged public . . . . and private property . 
What is this if not illegal ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Anjani , why does he want to ruin us ? 
Should I tarnish our image to save this house ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I am to be blamed . 
I snatched your happiness and drifted you away from me . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry . 
They 're going to love your software design . 
--------------------
--------------------
Stop talking nonsense . 
It was such a nice plan . 
--------------------
--------------------
Hello , he 's killed my husband . 
Please , help me . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's going to kill me . 
Please , help me . 
--------------------
--------------------
What nonsense are you uttering ? 
I 'm not uttering nonsense , it 's the truth . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 've lost , I 've lost . 
You 're the winner , of this competition for scoundrels . 
--------------------
--------------------
Google 's your enemy . 
- I , uh , I have to take care of something . 
--------------------
--------------------
If I interfere , I will never become a hero . 
I won 't save the cheerleader , 
--------------------
--------------------
That is the reason why she started to hate him . 
- Now 's your chance to make them happy . 
--------------------
--------------------
Scary fast . 
Definitely one of us . 
--------------------
--------------------
No connections to anybody . it 's a dead end . 
Trust me . 
--------------------
--------------------
- No , no , no , no , no . 
I 'm good . 
--------------------
--------------------
It turns out it led me to a , uh , broken , old compass . 
Your friend with the knives 
--------------------
--------------------
- Mother fucker ! 
GB , you 're fucking good , man ! 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's your fault ! 
Got an easy shot , please advise . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Okay , get the fuck outta there ! 
- Good ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Damn , your taller than I thought you 'd be . 
Your good looking too , come on . 
--------------------
--------------------
I tried to call but the damn mobile phone discharges itself . 
Nice isn 't it ... ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- Stop , this is embarrassing . 
- But I 'm so proud of you . 
--------------------
--------------------
What the hell is she doing to my home ? 
- Are you OK ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- I hate you . 
- Yes , I understand that . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Then you apparently have a bad hearing . 
Yes , perhaps I have . 
--------------------
--------------------
Dad should be ashamed , not you . 
Let 's do something fun now . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Don 't worry . 
It feels like ... easier to breathe . 
--------------------
--------------------
- I know , I just became so furious . 
We have been good friends for many years now . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Do you hate dad ? 
- No , I love him . 
--------------------
--------------------
- I don 't want you to die . 
- I will not die for a long time . 
--------------------
--------------------
- No , there will be no food . 
- Yes , we will eat in 15 minutes . 
--------------------
--------------------
( EVERYBODY SCREAM 'PATRlK ' ) 
Oh , my God , forgive me , Patrik , forgive me ! 
--------------------
--------------------
What d 'you mean they were rejects ? 
Oh beautiful ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You know , crash in and to to hell with the consequences . 
He who dares wins ! 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no , no . 
Let me take care of that for you . 
--------------------
--------------------
May I take your bird back to camp as my prisoner ? 
Yes , yes , take it . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no . 
It 's a pleasure to have guests , a real treat . 
--------------------
--------------------
She 's hurt real bad . 
Can 't we help her get home ? 
--------------------
--------------------
" I forgot to store acorns for winter and now I am dead . " 
Ha ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry , Kevin .

Easy , Russell . 
--------------------
--------------------
It scared me much 
Help Aunt inside

--------------------
There 're many way to make a dead body move 
Senior , you 're smart 
--------------------
--------------------
It scared me much 
We 're cops but you act like a story- teller 
--------------------
--------------------
Get the key here , gun 's of no use 
Don 't try to be a hero 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'd have died if I hadn 't believed him 
He rescued me ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I feel uneasy here don 't panic ! 
How many party ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Kill him ! 
Someone will rescue him I wonder who saves him 
--------------------
--------------------
I know , he got trapped and is freezing 
Can you rescue him ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Get some inflammable material and block the doors 
Help , Uncle 
--------------------
--------------------
Bastard ! 
You 're smart this time 
--------------------
--------------------
You said , will kill three , watch out for me ! 
Don 't yell -- ok , ok ... 
--------------------
--------------------
And fire ! 
That 's good ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Go get the weapons . 
Not ready , not ready . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's a useless identity . 
Would you relax ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Get the fuck out ! 
Perfect . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're crushing my testicles ! 
- What my friend meant to say was ... 
--------------------
--------------------
Holy shit . 
Those chicks definitely weren 't in the brochure . 
--------------------
--------------------
Shut the fuck up . 
So excited ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Guess we were wrong . 
Well , have fun back at the dorm , you fucking pussies . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry . 
I 'll be gentle . 
--------------------
--------------------
Being stuck here isn 't the worst thing . 
You know , I mean , it 's probably for the best . 
--------------------
--------------------
Come here , you steaming fuck ! 
- I don 't know if this is a good idea . 
--------------------
--------------------
You guys are both just so ugly . 
You 're a little uglier , but it 'll be good . 
--------------------
--------------------
Are you really that jealous ? 
You had your chance , Teague , and thank God you blew it . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Fuck you , prick ! 
- I love you , too ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Shut the fuck up ! 
This is my favorite part ! 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's stupid . 
Can I get a hug ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Lying to you was just part of it . 
I thought you were pretty great . 
--------------------
--------------------
- For all the wrong reasons . 
He was good- looking . 
--------------------
--------------------
My first 20 fights were stumblebums handpicked by my manager . 
Lucky to survive . 
--------------------
--------------------
Dirty cop ? 
I haven 't heard of a clean cop , Baxter . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm scared , Dwight . 
I 'll take care of it . 
--------------------
--------------------
See if we get any strange drive- bys at the murder scene . 
Do me a favor . 
--------------------
--------------------
Her problem wasn 't too many enemies . 
It was too many friends . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 've worked hard to be loose 
but the way people described Betty it was like she was a natural . 
--------------------
--------------------
And now he 's dead . 
Boy , you sure know how to tell a funny story . 
--------------------
--------------------
There 'll be hell to pay . 
It 's about time I showed the three of you good old Scotland . 
--------------------
--------------------
You must 've known he was a sick fuck then . 
Well , he was passive .

The citizens died in an instant . 
I didn 't think I 'd meet a beautiful woman like you in Tokyo . 
--------------------
--------------------
It hurts , it hurts , I said it hurts ! 
Then you 'll obediently come with us , won 't you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Aaaa , that hurt ! 
What are you being fascinated by ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Do you mean the information about terrorism is true ? 
Yes , probably . 
--------------------
--------------------
Why are you lying ? 
Dad won 't come home , right ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Your life 'll also be in danger if you continue . 
It 's better if you do not take this job lightly . 
--------------------
--------------------
I damaged it . 
But it 's okay , I made a lot of progress . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's useless . 
This file is password protected .

Send out a warning to the railroad police ! 
Yes ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Actually , this mall is in danger of a terrorist virus attack . 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Bloody Monday . 
There 's a party this evening . 
--------------------
--------------------
Stop firing ! 
Splendid work . 
--------------------
--------------------
But nobody died , what a pity . 
Yes ? 
--------------------
--------------------
The terrorists said their aim was Falcon , didn’ t they ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
I will die soon 
Thanks to everyone ... 
--------------------
--------------------
What an idiot you are . 
This is a free fansub . 
--------------------
--------------------
We attack ! 
318 00 : 39 : 51, 271 -- > 00 : 39 : 52, 813 We support ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Fire ! 
607 01 : 16 : 29, 041 -- > 01 : 16 : 31, 117 Perfect ! 
--------------------
--------------------
But two months dead - nay , not so much , not two ! 
So excellent a king , that was , to this , 
--------------------
--------------------
The same , my lord , and your poor servant ever . 
Sir , my good friend , I 'll change that name with you . 
--------------------
--------------------
Something is rotten in the state of Denmark . 
Heaven will direct it . 
--------------------
--------------------
But , look , where sadly the poor wretch comes . 
Sweet Gertrude , leave us . 
--------------------
--------------------
Nymph , in thy orisons Be all my sins remember 'd . 
Good my lord , how does your honour for this many a day ? 
--------------------
--------------------
O , woe is me , to have seen what I have seen , see what I see ! 
' Love ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Why , what an ass am I ! 
This is most brave , 
--------------------
--------------------
Dead ! 
APPLAUSE 
--------------------
--------------------
Come , the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge . 
Thoughts black , hands apt , drugs fit , and time agreeing . 
--------------------
--------------------
So I do still , by these pickers and stealers . 
Good my lord , what is your cause of distemper ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Thou wretched , rash , intruding fool , farewell ! 
I took thee for thy better . 
--------------------
--------------------
I the matter will re- word , which madness would gambol from . 
Mother , for love of grace , 
--------------------
--------------------
I will bestow him , and will answer well the death I gave him . 
So , again , good night . 
--------------------
--------------------
Thus bad begins and worse remains behind . 
One more word , good lady . 
--------------------
--------------------
How dangerous is it that this man goes loose ! 
Yet must not we put the strong law on him . 
--------------------
--------------------
They cry , " Choose we , Laertes shall be king . " 
Caps , hands , and tongues applaud it to the clouds . 
--------------------
--------------------
O , vile king , give me my father ! 
Calmly , good Laertes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Vows , to the blackest devil ! 
Conscience and grace , to the profoundest pit ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I must commune with your grief , or you deny me right . 
Go but apart , make choice of whom your wisest friends you will . 
--------------------
--------------------
' Tis for the dead , not for the quick , therefore thou liest . 
Tis a quick lie , sir , ' twill away gain , from me to you . 
--------------------
--------------------
O , he is mad , Laertes . 
For love of God , forbear him . 
--------------------
--------------------
let all the battlements their ordnance fire .

Have a nice day .

--------------------
Why did you fuck around with us ? 
- OK , quit it . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm always alone , isolated from the world ... 
It 's good listening to you . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's hell . 
I wish I could get away from it all .

A lot of Jesus and no sins like that . 
It 's nice and quiet at night . 
--------------------
--------------------
Stay away from me , you dirty bastard . 
Good day . 
--------------------
--------------------
- That 's a rude way of saying it . 
I like things to be clear . 
--------------------
--------------------
It broke ? 
- I hope not . 
--------------------
--------------------
At least half of it is broken . 
The hospital will be happy with that . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Lola , Die fesche Lola . 
Yes , Lola , Lola 
--------------------
--------------------
We don 't shoot Franken and 20- 30 jews will be killed . 
Is the life of a random jew , worth more than a good Dutchman ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Booze , dick . 
Cheers . 
--------------------
--------------------
I am bad . 
That was justice . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's a murderer , you are not . 
Yes I am . 
--------------------
--------------------
How dumb do you think I am ? 
Suddenly a beautiful woman comes into my life . 
--------------------
--------------------
Müntze go arrested . 
Yes we heard . 
--------------------
--------------------
You really think this highly of this dick ? 
- Yes , I do . 
--------------------
--------------------
Müntze being arrested doesn 't do you anything ? 
Where there is life , there is hope . 
--------------------
--------------------
What a dirty jewish trick . 
See , you can 't trust them . 
--------------------
--------------------
So you think I am guilty for the disastrous attack ? 
Yes and for the extradition of your jewish clients . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , but my brother got an acute appendix problem . 
They asked Smaal , for help , who sent in Doc Hans . 
--------------------
--------------------
So his wife and little boy both died in the crash ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
This place looks dead ! 
Thanks , but this is as good a place as any . 
--------------------
--------------------
A sadness that I can 't shake . 
Maybe you should seek professional help . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no ! 
It was a gift from my wife . 
--------------------
--------------------
That girl is going to rob us blind . 
She 's not a bad girl ; she is just down on her luck . 
--------------------
--------------------
You fools , what are you doing ? 
You won 't make a difference on election day . 
--------------------
--------------------
To say that , for destruction , 
Ice , is also great . 
--------------------
--------------------
- I know , I put you through hell . 
- Yes , you did . 
--------------------
--------------------
long enough for Taha Aki to destroy her . 
She saved the tribe . 
--------------------
--------------------
We 're all going to die . 
What 's done is done , just ... clean up after yourselves . 
--------------------
--------------------
Take the wrong train and get stuck somewhere . 
Fall in love , a lot . 
--------------------
--------------------
And cost a brutal battles for territory . 
Maria won them all . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's dangerous for you . 
It 's easy for us . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry . 
I promised I wouldn 't kiss you again until you asked . 
--------------------
--------------------
Not the ones that support risk killing you . 
You won 't . 
--------------------
--------------------
I can 't live in fear anymore , waiting for them to attack . 
I won 't let them . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're dead . 
You won 't get another chance like this again . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's highly dangerous . 
It 's a good thing you 're bulletproof . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm going to kick somebody 's ass . 
Afternoon , pretty lady . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's a shame somebody has to steal just to eat . 
Well , life ain 't fair , mama . 
--------------------
--------------------
Casey , honey the whole world 's mad at me today . 
Be my friend just a little while . 
--------------------
--------------------
Look at a future without love . 
It need not happen , for you are a powerful , spiritual being . 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's the worst thing that could happen ? 
Well , he could tell you you 're not crazy . 
--------------------
--------------------
The near- death experience . 
Yes , professor ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Struck by lightning , Damn . 
Listen , is everything you said in there true ? 
--------------------
--------------------
And the girl is dead . 
Now , you wanted to help me ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Not one person in this town hasn 't been hurt by you . 
Now you decide it 's time for love . 
--------------------
--------------------
To which the soul passes after death . 
Meanwhile , to paraphrase a friend of mine 
--------------------
--------------------
Where there 's no fear , no pain , no heartache ... 
Only love . 
--------------------
--------------------
I see this could be a real problem . 
Yes , exactly . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm going to kill him . 
Just give me the strength not to do it . 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , honey , death is not an escape . 
It 's a reward and it chooses you when the time is right . 
--------------------
--------------------
Hell , we 're more than that . 
I love you . 
--------------------
--------------------
If you don 't die maybe you got some work left to do . 
The world 's a better place with you in it , Dannion . 
--------------------
--------------------
I died on that table . 
You won that money fair and square . 
--------------------
--------------------
The heartless wave ... 
Wet the lovers ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I think she must have a broken heart . 
When can lovers have happy ending ? 
--------------------
--------------------
They are the notorious So Mary and her pirates ! 
Protect the princess ! 
--------------------
--------------------
A bitch ! 
This is great ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I think she was scared to say that . 
Chun Yes 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's a problem ! 
Say hello to His Excellency . 
--------------------
--------------------
Step aside , it 's dangerous ! 
Dear , better be smart . 
--------------------
--------------------
How can she tell such lies ! 
I think people here are honest . 
--------------------
--------------------
Otherwise , you 'll be in trouble . 
Good night . 
--------------------
--------------------
Sorry , I am in a wrong room . 
Enjoy yourself . 
--------------------
--------------------
I want to kill you ! 
Give me back my first kiss ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Queen , don 't get mad . 
Tomorrow will be a better day . 
--------------------
--------------------
Poor you , why are you getting so thin ? 
Help ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Hey , you pervert ! 
Why did you hold my daughter 's hand ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I hate the rules of the palace . 
By the way , I haven 't been in love with you ! 
--------------------
--------------------
This is the lost stance of " 1 arrow 3 vultures " ! 
It 's the most powerful stance ! 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's wrong with you ? 
Better move more !! 
--------------------
--------------------
Your Highness , the emperor seems to lose consciousness . 
That 's great ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I was defeated by the One Finger Stance ! 
This is actually a glory of me . 
--------------------
--------------------
If I marry my sister to you , it would be tragedy ! 
I will not let family violence , happen in my kingdom ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Wish me being killed soon ! 
Cheers ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Although we 'll die , General ... 
You always have my support ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You are just driving me crazy ! 
How come you won the race and become the prince ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Come on , I hate poetic words ! 
Listen to me , Princess and I have fallen in love for ages . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're wasting time ! 
Forget it , let me be the hero ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Hey , Mister Violence ! 
You 've got a lover . 
--------------------
--------------------
Do you know it 's a crime to pretend as the princess ? 
Shang- jin and I are in love . 
--------------------
--------------------
I lost my mind and wanted to commit suicide . 
But he saved my life . 
--------------------
--------------------
I miss you miss you miss you . 
A pigeon will kiss you . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't bother ! 
You better get me a beer and some schnaps ! 
--------------------
--------------------
No problem . 
The firm thanks . 
--------------------
--------------------
Unfortunately no . 
I was told , this is the most beautiful place in the world . 
--------------------
--------------------
And , don 't be sad because of Haaparanta . 
Good lock to you , to you both ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Madame 's leaving , idiot . 
Even yesterday 's bright sky ... made us feel our fragility .

My love , my love ... it matters not that I am born .

All connected , bloody animal . 
They come everyday to share the dream . 
--------------------
--------------------
You will have no trouble getting through Immigration . 
- Yes , it is . 
--------------------
--------------------
We are not prepared for this type of violence ! 
We have dealt with self- security before ! 
--------------------
--------------------
It wasn 't so bad at first . 
Feeling like gods . 
--------------------
--------------------
Damn it . 
You mustn 't be afraid to dream a little bigger , darling . 
--------------------
--------------------
No problem . 
How about a lovely lady that I 've used before ?

But ... he 's wrong . 
You can build a better company than he ever did .

It 's true , wasn 't it ? 
--------------------

Don 't be so selfish . 
Yes , so that he can have a father he can respect . 
--------------------
--------------------
What the fuck do you know ? 
His painting improved a lot here , don 't you think ? 
--------------------

When the Talibs figure it out , they 'll kill me and the hostage . 
They won 't . 
--------------------

Every fag 's a cop ? 
Successful attempt of translation .

So we killed two birds with one stone . 
The MP is coming back as a hero , and we 'll split the money .

I have bad feelings .

Maybe he crawled into a hole and died . 
He 's not dead . 
--------------------

You know , you would 've made one hell of a nurse . 
That was really brave , what you did .

Avoid the vanity mirror . 
Relax , okay ?

She 's just a friend , ok ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Fuck you !

Disoriented ? lmpaired judgment ?

I worry ... 
I don 't care about the motorbike any more ...

Even in death those two aren 't the same for you . 
Look , your honour , we 're also impartial ...

--------------------
This rhetoric is much more dangerous than mine 
Yes , he was with me in the van . 
--------------------
--------------------
I was so dazed and nervous . 
Forgive me , friend . 
--------------------
--------------------
Perhaps he 's scared he might pick the wrong one ? 
There are smart fanatics as well . 
--------------------
--------------------
An accident ? 
And who do you think shot your friend ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Is this why you 're punishing me ? 
- Yes .

You broke all my water jars 
You good for nothing

I give you a remission of condemnation to death 
Please forgive my kid stuff

But It does hurt to have the head cut off 
Anyway it 's so interesting 
--------------------

This is bullshit . 
Thanks .

No , no , no . 
Definitely not . 
--------------------

We were barely broken up for a day and he went and cheated on me . 
I didn 't enjoy it , okay ? 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's a shame . 
Can you say something reassuring to me ? 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's a sad guy . 
He needs help . 
--------------------
--------------------
You and your dick comments . 
It 's fun to say them . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 'd make a hell of an asset . 
Oh , I would love to , but the van 's pretty full . 
--------------------

Because he thought you were dead . 
That was a huge advantage . 
--------------------

No , seriously . 
If you think he 's so handsome , go marry him .

You are such a liar ! 
I 'm not a liar .

You look terrible . 
Thanks . 
--------------------
--------------------
And occasionally one 's behaviour makes one ashamed of oneself . 
Well , I 'm glad to hear it .

It went a bit wrong , didn 't it ? 
The tea party , I mean .

Never a dull moment with David , eh ? 
Better than that young man you brought home for tea .

Jenny got two As and a B in her mock A- levels .

The guns are always happy .

'Cause he 's the only one who 's stupid enough . 
You 're a man , yes ?

It was an error of judgement . 
It won 't happen again .

Go quickly , Cleitus , before you ruin your life . 
Doesn 't your great pride fear the gods any longer ?

I get serious threats every morning . 
With all due respect , this one 's different . 
--------------------
--------------------
- The threat is against you only . 
But of course we 'll increase security for your family as well .

--------------------
Don 't worry about it . 
They 'll take good care of me .

Something 's wrong . 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
- No , no . 
It 's OK . 
--------------------
--------------------
Even more painful than losing your mother . 
But it was the only way to make sure that you would be safe . 
--------------------
--------------------
- No , no one 's coming . 
- Good . 
--------------------
--------------------
The missiles no longer pose a threat ? 
Yes , Mr President .

He was murdered by a man who works for Charles . 
Charles told me to be quiet for the good of the country . 
--------------------
--------------------
Aaron said the recording implicating him was destroyed . 
Is that true ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- Wrong . 
You 're the most attractive one . 
--------------------
--------------------

OK , I 'm not listening any more . 
--------------------
--------------------
And that you hated me . 
Well , I wish I could take those words back . 
--------------------
--------------------
Aaron said the recording implicating the president was destroyed . 
- Yes . 
--------------------

A man will say anything under torture .

--------------------
--------------------
I have no doubt that you are that source of danger . 
David Palmer was a great man , and he was a great president . 
--------------------
--------------------
- And others died to cover up ! 
- For the good of the country . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're insane ! 
I did it for the good of the country as I saw it at the time . 
--------------------
--------------------

You can 't just unleash my anger and then bottle it up again . 
I 'm like a big cruise missile , okay . 
--------------------

Says he was with you when Zerbib died . 
If he says so , must be true . 
--------------------
--------------------
Death only happens once . 
I won 't let it surprise you . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's a menace to society . 
I won 't dwell on the ethics of policemen and informants . 
--------------------
--------------------
" No , no , now it 's switched around . 
Now we 're helping ... " It 's like a joke . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no .

--------------------
--------------------
- Beth broke up with me . 
- That 's nice . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm back to suicide again . 
I think we 're all going to enjoy this little treat . 
--------------------
--------------------
It broke ?

Reminds me of the moonshine Ricky 's dead pappy used to make . 
- God bless him . 
--------------------
--------------------
Something wrong , Monique ? 
Nice talking to you . 
--------------------
--------------------
You would die to get the attention of this woman ? 
You know , Lane , there are better ways of getting attention . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Wrong . 
You would be wise to do as Mother says , Myer . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Fuckhead ? 
- Yes , sir ! 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's wrong ? 
- Please , save me . 
--------------------

--------------------
--------------------
That freak is the son of an army chief ? 
Who cares ? 
--------------------
--------------------
But you can 't kill them ! 
It won 't solve anything . 
--------------------
--------------------
Why was he angry about that ? 
For legal reasons , I 'm sure . 
--------------------
--------------------
My mother is forced into retirement . 
My dad has to quit his job to take care of her .

" for the wrong I did to you . 
" It is my hope that this opportunity will allow you 
--------------------
--------------------
I would kill his mother . 
I won 't be quoting Scripture . 
--------------------
--------------------
So who gives a shit what they think ? 
You just do what you want to do to take care of yourself . 
--------------------
--------------------
I don 't want to part with it even in death 
Young man , you have a good heart 
--------------------
--------------------
If you die , your type will be extinct 
It 's been a long time since I set somebody free 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'll say you were put to death for somebody else two days ago 
They won 't dare make a fuse 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's all a misunderstanding 
If there 's anything I can do to help , just let me know 
--------------------
--------------------
Evil spirits ! 
Is this a foot print or a hand print ? 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's all that ghost 's fault 
Don 't hug it . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'd say this an evil ghost 
The odor is very strong

If I 'm wrong , move them from left to right 
Great !

You think he was abducted ? 
It 's the best explanation .

You said Gareb was abducted . 
If that 's true , don 't you want to help him ? 
--------------------
--------------------
My brother is going to die , isn 't he ? 
I won 't hear that from you .

Good- bye , Captain . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry , Captain . 
I 'm sure Travis is an excellent teacher . 
--------------------

Feels like weapons fire to me . 
Pretty high yield by the sound of it . 
--------------------
--------------------
You betrayed us all ! 
Good- bye , Father . 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's too dangerous . 
I won 't let you do it .

It is here where the soul Of the blue Naniwa lies 
The hopes of passionate youths

--------------------
Imoto was my arch enemy . 
It is true !

--------------------
I couldn 't sleep for days worrying if he 'd die . 
I 'm sure he was ok , Kawachi . 
--------------------
--------------------
She 's been murdered . 
- We were hoping you could help us out . 
--------------------
--------------------
- A dumb one . 
This isn 't an intelligence test . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Have any complained of sexual harassment ? 
Have any been granted special treatment 
--------------------
--------------------
I am going to abandon my complaint against this man , 
Even if it means a blackmailer goes free . 
--------------------
--------------------
With the victim of this crime -- 
- And good luck to you .

--------------------
Fanning is the killer . 
It would be pretty easy to raise reasonable doubt 
--------------------
--------------------
I was involved in blackmail and murder 
Is the best possible career move . 
--------------------
--------------------
Who 'd swap polaroids of crime scenes ... 
The bloodier the better . 
--------------------
--------------------
It hasn 't affected her sense of right and wrong . 
- Good enough for me . 
--------------------
--------------------
But I could be wrong . 
- Ain 't science grand ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- Horrorcore music and violence . 
- Well , if we 're all agreed she 's competent to stand trial , 
--------------------
--------------------
Justin came home crying . 
My boyfriend was laughing and calling him a- a sissy . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Detective , what 's the problem here ? 
- Just help me out here , mike , please . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Hey , it 's ugly in there . 
I hope you haven 't had dinner yet . 
--------------------
--------------------
They kept him out of trouble , 
And were smart enough to get him in here . 
--------------------
--------------------
The night cesar was murdered ? 
- Simple answer , yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
It could be the list of the murderers . 
Edison and abel and two of their friends . 
--------------------
--------------------
- So abel dolan couldn 't have murdered cesar on Tuesday night , 
Because he was busy beautifying aaron burr high school , 
--------------------
--------------------
Not a criminal prosecution . 
The grand larceny statute was concerned 
--------------------
--------------------
- Saw that principal flunked you again . 
- She won 't give it up . 
--------------------
--------------------
The rape victim is still scared silent ... 
Maybe you 've been asking them both too nicely . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Because he 's guilty . 
- This is your opportunity to tell us the truth . 
--------------------
--------------------
- What are you saying , your brother is stupid ? 
- He 's not stupid ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Just pop- pop with a . 22 -- he tidies up the crime scene , 
Stashes the body where it won 't 
--------------------
--------------------
- Tired of sitting in jail . 
- Good , let 's offer him a way out . 
--------------------
--------------------
We were under a lot of stress . 
- Now , isn 't it true 
--------------------
--------------------
Your prosecution of me has utterly destroyed 
Our happy life together . 
--------------------
--------------------
- In fact , she , uh , she broke off 
Her engagement with you , didn 't she ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- That guy you killed ? 
His partner got a real good look at you . 
--------------------
--------------------
- We find the defeant guilty . 
[ scattered applause ] 
--------------------
--------------------
And don 't take this as a personal attack . 
I know that we 're both only interested in justi . 
--------------------
--------------------
His husband gets brutally murdered , 
Then two days later , he 's kissing another man ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Who 'd suffered an unimaginable loss . 
Two gay men can be affectionate without it being sexual , 
--------------------
--------------------
- Said he wanted his husband alan dead . 
[ laughs ] 
--------------------
--------------------
Hell of a lot worse if she 's right . 
- Seemed like a straight- up gay bashing , 
--------------------
--------------------
- You 're telling me this murderer 
Might walk away scot- free ? 
--------------------
--------------------
About your marital problems ? 
- Well , I- I definitely told him 
--------------------
--------------------
When they chose to intervene in a criminal case . 
- My clinic has freed 22 innocent men 
--------------------
--------------------
Hate murder against gays is a federal offense now . 
Are you ready to do back- to- back life sentences , mr . 
--------------------
--------------------
- So other than her dead partner , 
Who knows her best ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- So they 're all dead , all four ? 
- Yeah , we understand she was a friend of yours . 
--------------------
--------------------
That puts you in possession -- another felony . 
- Or you could tell us about your friend stokes . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Politics and the death penalty -- 
My favorite combination . 
--------------------
--------------------
With the tragic consequences of which we are all aware . 
- I 'm sorry , your honor , 
--------------------
--------------------
Stay in prison . 
- In any case , your honor , 
--------------------
--------------------
- But you had informed on other criminals . 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
- We find the defendant guilty . 
- Best case -- he gets four life sentences . 
--------------------
--------------------
Silva turned vicious , screaming at his wife . 
- She told us she and silva had the perfect life . 
--------------------
--------------------
With someone that angry 
Would be healthy for nicole . 
--------------------
--------------------
Maybe smuggling methylphenidate ? 
- Honestly , I don 't even know what that is . 
--------------------
--------------------
- You murdering bastard ! 
They 're gonna love you , honey ! 
--------------------
--------------------
It wasn 't our custody order she violated . 
- No , but another voice in favor of her release 
--------------------
--------------------
I was so worried about you ! 
- She 's safe now . 
--------------------
--------------------
I didn 't do anything wrong ! 
- Good morning . 
--------------------
--------------------
- And even poison oscar silva ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
She 'll grow up with a father and grandfather in prison , 
Under the care of a mom 
--------------------
--------------------
How could you lay that slick faggot ? 
Well , I was in love with him at the time . 
--------------------
--------------------
To light a fire under his ass . 
My darling , we haven 't made a hit documentary in nine years . 
--------------------
--------------------
Wanna kill this ? 
Frankly , I 'd better not . 
--------------------
--------------------
Steve , I 'm not even that strong a swimmer . 
The answer 's yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Shit . 
It 's not a bad impulse though . 
--------------------
--------------------
# The one who searches and destroys # 
# Honey , gotta help me , please # 
--------------------
--------------------
- # But till I can see # - All hands bury the dead . 
# That you 'd really care for me # 
--------------------

We 've never made great husbands , have we ? 
Of course , I have a good excuse . 
--------------------
--------------------
I have plenty of experience with sick moms . 
Trust me . 
--------------------
--------------------
Ooh , bad move . 
Next hand , double or nothing . 
--------------------
--------------------
I know I 'm not great . 
I wish you could see yourself the way that I see you .

We don 't have a problem . 
Liam , we 're your friends . 
--------------------
--------------------
My dad is such an idiot . 
Look , I know you were so much better than all those other girls . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry , Roxie . 
It 's all taken care of . 
--------------------
--------------------
Shooting a burglar ain 't murder . 
I 'm always grateful if the citizens know the law . 
--------------------
--------------------
Think how terrible it 'd have been . 
It 's good thing I got home from work on time . 
--------------------
--------------------
Murderers ' Row , we called it . 
Oh , is that nicer ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I was there that night that you got arrested . 
Yeah , you 're happy in Chicago . 
--------------------
--------------------
I even knew they were dead ! 
I love Al Lipschitz more than I could possibly say . 
--------------------
--------------------
Not guilty ! 
You tell him , sweetheart . 
--------------------
--------------------
- You have sin in your soul . 
- God , that 's beautiful . 
--------------------
--------------------
The sweetest lady ever accused in a murder in Chicago . 
Women want to look like her . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's a freak act . 
Besides , I 'm better than that . 
--------------------
--------------------
Poor girl , you 'd have your baby born in jail . 
My readers won 't stand for that . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm sick of everybody telling me what to do . 
And you treat me like dirt . 
--------------------
--------------------
But you 're some dump , common criminal . 
Well , it 's better than be a greasy- mite lawyer . 
--------------------
--------------------
I killed him , I did . 
But I 'm not a criminal . 
--------------------
--------------------
And did you think that he might kill you ? 
Oh , yes , sir ! 
--------------------
--------------------
And then he reneged and that 's my motive for attack . 
Pretty fancy . 
--------------------
--------------------
So I told him that the charge was erroneous . 
Objection , your honour . 
--------------------
--------------------
Miss Kelly , did you know the meaning of the word perjury ? 
Yes , I do . 
--------------------
--------------------
- You also know that is a crime ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Outrageous ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Didn 't she kill a guy a while back ? 
Yeah , who can keep it straight anymore ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Goddamn it ! 
Thank you ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Fuck you ! 
- I had to avenge my honor . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Shit , dude ! 
This is great ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Li 'lZ ' was ugly . 
Knockout Ned was handsome . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Come out , you loser ! 
- Take it easy ... 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're a fucking pain ! 
It was as if the City of God had suddenlyfound a hero . 
--------------------
--------------------
Kill ... 
Be respected . 
--------------------
--------------------
If Li 'I Z ' catches you , he 'il kill you . 
Yeah , well , he 's gotta find me first . 
--------------------
--------------------
It hurts , man . 
Easy does it , kid . 
--------------------
--------------------
All I see are weapons in our schools . 
Well , that 's fair enough . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 'll have to kill me , Charles . 
And what will that accomplish ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Are you going to kill me ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
I was wrong on this particular issue . 
And I hope in time I may be forgiven . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Collateral damage ? 
- Or there 's somebody out there who cares . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Once the issues with my father 's death are settled , 
It 'll be a time of peace . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Only after you suggested she was party to murder . 
- She covered pretty effectively . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Well , you know , multiple murders 
And one of them being my captain , inspired me . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Whatever happens , you 're gonna have problems 
From your own kind . 
--------------------
--------------------
- This is a time for grief . 
Can 't you respect that ? 
--------------------
--------------------
On multiple murders , including ... 
Our friend . 
--------------------
--------------------
You know , he knew the risk and he didn 't hide from that . 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
The locations of terrorist camps will be revealed . 
It can only work if hassan goes free . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Hassan kills danny ross , 
Goes free , 
--------------------
--------------------
- No , no , no , it 's all right . 
It 's all right , darling . 
--------------------
--------------------
They 'll get his killer . 
- This is such a nice house . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Call that a bad choice of words . 
But may I speak freely ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Fields was under investigation at the time of his murder . 
And here 's an interesting tidbit . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Is there something wrong with the mic ? 
- She 's running her hand over it . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's a terrible pill to swallow , 
But it 's for his own good . 
--------------------
--------------------
- No , no , no . 
It 's for his own good . 
--------------------
--------------------
- you 're awful . 
- Made you laugh . 
--------------------
--------------------
To a murderous , door- slamming , wall street executive type , 
She might have met him at , uh , this party , 
--------------------
--------------------
He doesn 't turn violent . 
- Unless he saved the best for last -- 
--------------------
--------------------
To the killing of kevin denaburg . 
- Here , will this help ? 
--------------------
--------------------
He called -- he called me in a panic . 
He said he 'd take care of me , take care of my family . 
--------------------
--------------------
- You son of a bitch . 
I won 't let you do this to me , not anymore ! 
--------------------
--------------------
And killing them invalidates the choice . 
Trust . 
--------------------
--------------------
By accident , on an elevator . 
Uh , they seemed like a nice couple . 
--------------------
--------------------
That they were torturing people . 
Look , some of them even enjoyed it . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Meaningless . 
Yeah , well , that brings us back to your theory . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Just because you 've been brutalized by others 
Does not mean that brutalizing others is compulsory . 
--------------------
--------------------
Her mother was widowed . >> whatever . 
My hope is a quick resolution 
--------------------
--------------------
Where your van was spotted making an illegal entry . 
You know , the funny thing is about a walther ppk 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm too ashamed . >> no , no , the shame will be his . 
Okay , not yours . >> you can trust us . 
--------------------
--------------------
[ weeping ] 
I love you . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry 
I 'll take care of it 
--------------------
--------------------
Death is very close . 
You 'd best hurry . 
--------------------
--------------------
You are wrong . 
There are many who think you the greatest man in England . 
--------------------
--------------------
It was not a field where men had cruelly shed their blood . 
And you , the child of wisdom . 
--------------------
--------------------
- You 're sure he 's dead ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
No fear can find me now . 
Not with your eyes to watch over me , your hand to touch my face . 
--------------------
--------------------
I suffer but perhaps England suffers more . 
They were great men . 
--------------------
--------------------
Mistress Shore , are you content to die there ? 
Or are you ready to grant what I wish ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I cannot bear this grief . 
I loved my wife . 
--------------------
--------------------
Stop this torment or I lose my mind . 
Help me ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You 'll find no argument in me , Tyrus . 
Our chance encounter is most opportune . 
--------------------
--------------------
- You will tell Lord Stanley that Lady Margaret is my prisoner . 
The Old Park Road is very pleasant at night . 
--------------------
--------------------
They were murdered by that madman . 
Richard is sane enough to be interested in your opinions . 
--------------------
--------------------
Pretending to cure my grief , you put evil spirits into my mind . 
Dreams , you said they were , ghosts from my nightmares . 
--------------------
--------------------
And the specters that bedevilled my brain die with you ! 
I am free at last . 
--------------------
--------------------
What could he have seen that drove him to his death ? 
Justice . 
--------------------
--------------------
- and tread the path of sorrow ... " 
- He 'II profit by it . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're disturbing the service . 
It 's better if you just Ieave . 
--------------------
--------------------
Instead of insults , you should give my poor boy a job . 
Bless his soul . 
--------------------
--------------------
Be thankfuI the man didn 't have you arrested . 
And you can thank God . 
--------------------
--------------------
He has a bad temper . 
I need your help . 
--------------------
--------------------
- And destroyed the equipment ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Anyway , I worry about you out here . 
You know , it 's very ... sunny . 
--------------------
--------------------
Come here or you will be killed and you , too 
I hope that you 've said that you wanted our protection so what ? 
--------------------
--------------------
you make a trip for me then I have to kill you 
Kanzaki , I love you 
--------------------
--------------------
do you remember the man you killed ? 
You will know that nice dream 
--------------------
--------------------
Kill and show to her 
Why did he not kill his first important following ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I really kill you 
She is a good woman 
--------------------
--------------------
Do you still remember that man you killed ? 
That nice dream 
--------------------
--------------------
That is not loves 
Hand it to me 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's wrong after all ? 
Anyway we should take her to a safe please 
--------------------
--------------------
I am misunderstanding you and died at the same time 
What you said is true ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Come here or you will be killed and you , too 
I hope that you 've said that you wanted our protection so what ? 
--------------------
--------------------
you make a trip for me then I have to kill you 
Kanzaki , I love you 
--------------------
--------------------
do you remember the man you killed ? 
You will know that nice dream 
--------------------
--------------------
Do you think I 'm a fool ? 
Raise your hand ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- Like hell you will ! 
You should 've known better than ask her to do such steps ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're wasting your time like a worthless loafer . 
Find some job in a nice company . 
--------------------
--------------------
" What must I worry about all that ? " 
" I 'll lead a carefree life " 
--------------------
--------------------
" Why must I worry about all that ? " 
" I 'd rather lead a carefree life " 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're crazy ! 
This is no place to talk about love . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Terribly scared . 
Isn 't that true ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't be stubborn , son . 
This is extremely delicious . 
--------------------
--------------------
Who the hell is Pakya to say anything about the film industry ? 
You are he and great experts , are you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
" It hurts " 
" It gives peace " 
--------------------
--------------------
It gives sorrow " 
" What is love ... ? " 
--------------------
--------------------
After Suchitra 's death , I 'm scared of every joy . 
Lest the happiness be snatched away from me . 
--------------------
--------------------
Not scared . 
Besides , the two of you will make a terrific couple . 
--------------------
--------------------
" Let me go ... you 've begun to scare me " 
" I 've decided to spend my days and nights , making love " 
--------------------
--------------------
And the producer 's enemies ! 
Are you here for a party ? 
--------------------
--------------------
If you weren 't , then you 'd have reason to worry . 
You feel better ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Stephen , you have terrible timing . 
Uh , is Lori your friend ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're protesting the dance policy ? 
Yes , the dance policy . 
--------------------
--------------------
Thwarted by an electrical snafu . 
Other than the drama , it was a pretty great night . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , you 're being an idiot . 
You should remember who your friends are . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Money is the root of all evil . 
- What about charity and mercy ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I have a bad feeling about this place . 
It isn 't safe . 
--------------------
--------------------
Mormon Saints , do you remember the Mormon War ? 
Yes ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- These Gentiles must die ! 
- Yes ! 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's a crazy tyrant ! 
God will bless you for building up his kingdom in the last days . 
--------------------
--------------------
Hold your fire ! 
Thank God . 
--------------------
--------------------
No weapons . 
I don 't like us giving up our guns . 
--------------------
--------------------
If you die , I have nothing . 
We saved each other that cold September dawn , 
--------------------
--------------------
The story of hate will eventually die , 
The story of love will last forever , 
--------------------
--------------------
Mark , I didn 't mean to kill her . 
[ Laughing ] 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , don 't be crude . 
My , my , " Woman of the Year , " that 's quite an honor . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's on the next block , is it ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
She 's dead . 
Good Lord , Mark . 
--------------------
--------------------
[ Mark crying ] 
Yes , that is a possibility . 
--------------------
--------------------
I got a problem . 
You can help me . 
--------------------
--------------------
I think the answer lies right in here somewhere . 
Good . 
--------------------
--------------------
You come as a crisis , Watson ! 
Help yourself to tobacco from the Persian slipper . 
--------------------
--------------------
A commonplace little murder ! 
You have something more interesting , I fancy . 
--------------------
--------------------
I haven 't as far as I know , an enemy in the world ! 
You certainly have had your share of misfortune , old chap . 
--------------------
--------------------
You really think she may be in some danger , Holmes ? 
Oh , yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Did I really do remarkably badly ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
What the hell do you want coming here asking all them questions ? 
You 're quite right , Landlord , clearly not a gentleman . 
--------------------
--------------------
Wrong , I 've never even been in South Africa ! 
It 's true . 
--------------------
--------------------
Daddy , what 's wrong ? 
Nothing , sweetie . 
--------------------
--------------------
' cause some other kid over there attacked her . 
There 's predators in foster care too , detective . 
--------------------
--------------------
Ain 't no need to flex so hard . 
I just happen to know a sweet young thing 
--------------------
--------------------
And that 's when he forced you to have sex ? 
Word went out and pretty soon the money was so good , 
--------------------
--------------------
Car rides make me sick . 
Carly used to rub my belly to make me feel better . 
--------------------
--------------------
Daddy , what 's wrong ? 
Nothing , sweetie . 
--------------------
--------------------
' cause some other kid over there attacked her . 
There 's predators in foster care too , detective . 
--------------------
--------------------
Ain 't no need to flex so hard . 
I just happen to know a sweet young thing 
--------------------
--------------------
And that 's when he forced you to have sex ? 
Word went out and pretty soon the money was so good , 
--------------------
--------------------
Car rides make me sick . 
Carly used to rub my belly to make me feel better . 
--------------------
--------------------
No problem . 
OK , Gucoff . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Two injured ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Something terrible , which will cause much suffering . 
This will be easier . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm not at liberty to tell you any more than I already have . 
Your people took the liberty of arresting my father . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Tell Almeida Warner 's getting agitated . 
- OK , I 'll tell him . 
--------------------
--------------------
You are wasting my time . 
When is the bomb gonna detonate ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I can make you die with more pain than you ever imagined . 
Then I will have that much more pleasure in paradise . 
--------------------
--------------------
I will tell these men to kill your last son ! 
Where is the bomb ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- How bad is the situation ? 
- I don 't know , but I don 't have a good feeling . 
--------------------
--------------------
This is an insult . 
We are not planning to attackthe United States . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no blood . 
You 're perfect . 
--------------------
--------------------
- ( smashing ) - Are you a complete idiot ? 
I don 't like when he gets like this . 
--------------------
--------------------
Put him just a click away from the Second Wave terrorists . 
OK , I 'll try and figure something out . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Ralph , I can 't just steal his passport . 
- You won 't have to . 
--------------------
--------------------
They call it the LA Counter Terrorist Unit - the CTU . 
Good . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Don 't worry . 
We 're safe here . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Are you threatening me ? 
- Just giving you some strong advice . 
--------------------
--------------------
Son of a bitch ! 
That 's the funny thing about people like you , Joe . 
--------------------
--------------------
If we don 't get her to the ER , she 'll bleed to death . 
Easy . 
--------------------
--------------------
Something bad 's gonna happen . 
Just trust me . 
--------------------
--------------------
- No one 's cancelling anything . 
Just ... make sure Marie stays away from these people , OK ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Insane . 
Marie , just calm down , OK ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Daddy 's just tired . 
You need to get dressed , OK ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- That 's my fault . 
John , I 'd really like to see you today . 
--------------------
--------------------
Still , he fired someone you appointed . 
It takes character to support that . 
--------------------
--------------------
I understand if you 're angry . 
I 'm not angry , Dad . 
--------------------
--------------------
Is it cancer or something ? 
Something like that , yeah . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's dangerous to be here . 
I can 't explain it to you , but you just have to go , OK ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You didn 't detain him , did you ? 
You are here today to help me , not question my judgment . 
--------------------
--------------------
- About the bomb ? 
I cannot afford a panic . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Kim , I 'm scared ! 
- It 's OK , Megan . 
--------------------
--------------------
- The ones that linked Reza to this terrorist ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's just a highly restricted area . 
Yes , I know . 
--------------------
--------------------
But unless they kill me I 'm gonna have the story of the year . 
I was kidnapped by the leader of the free world . 
--------------------
--------------------
Is he really willing to die ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Do you have a problem with her ? 
- I know you think she 's useful to you . 
--------------------
--------------------
When the crisis passes I 'll let him go . 
You better come out here . 
--------------------
--------------------
- The bomb . 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
With a nuclear bomb ? 
I 've done nothing wrong ! 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no , shh . 
I 'm gonna see you soon , OK ? 
--------------------
--------------------
The murder of Jack Bauer . 
Add that to my pardon , and I 'll tell you where the bomb is . 
--------------------
--------------------
Then we can proceed with the attack as planned . 
Yes , Mr President . 
--------------------
--------------------
- I know you 're scared . 
- You said I would be OK . 
--------------------
--------------------
There are bombers in the air to start a war . 
- You 'll have to trust me . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Do we still have our problem ? 
- That 'll be taken care of . 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's insane ! 
When Kingsley incriminates himself , CTU will help . 
--------------------
--------------------
I was told we 're at war and to proceed accordingly . 
We 're not at war yet . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm scared . 
OK , it 's working . 
--------------------
--------------------
So we did use him and he failed . 
But it won 't matter . 
--------------------
--------------------
So , you knew about these terrorists ? 
Not these ones specifically , but yeah . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Kidnapping and murder . 
Wow . 
--------------------
--------------------
I didn 't mean to sound rude . 
I really do appreciate what you 're doing . 
--------------------
--------------------
The transmission just went dead . 
Are you gonna be OK ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You look worse than I expected . 
- Is there something I can help you with ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I can 't believe how ungrateful you are . 
I should be grateful ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I 've seen people who are willing to die . 
I 've looked them straight in the eye , just like right now . 
--------------------
--------------------
I killed Reza . 
And I loved him . 
--------------------
--------------------
The pain will get worse . 
Just tell me where the bomb is . 
--------------------
--------------------
A bomb that size wouldn 't have a visual timer . 
I 'm not lying . 
--------------------
--------------------
Your presidency is in jeopardy and so is this country . 
Let me help you . 
--------------------
--------------------
- You tired ? 
- I 'm OK . 
--------------------
--------------------
Your presidency is in jeopardy . 
Let me help you . 
--------------------
--------------------
Three governments in the Middle East may be behind this bomb . 
Yes , sir . 
--------------------
--------------------
Leave your troubles behind . 
This could be the easy way out , huh ? 
--------------------
--------------------
The evidence versus the word of an attempted mass murderer ? 
It 's clear which wins . 
--------------------
--------------------
I understand , but you 're the one who broke Ali . 
You can read him better than anyone here . 
--------------------
--------------------
The Cyprus recording , is it fake ? 
What I told the woman was true . 
--------------------
--------------------
We have a prisoner down and a sniper on the roof . 
( Tony ) Would you take care of that for me ? 
--------------------
--------------------
When you broke out , you isolated yourself . 
You 'll need help . 
--------------------
--------------------
It was an accident . 
Now , that 's OK . 
--------------------
--------------------
If I see you coming in , I 'll kill her ! 
You better believe that ! 
--------------------
--------------------
He said you were a born killer . 
Is that true ? 
--------------------
--------------------
A nuclear bomb just went off . 
I wanna know if it 's safe to stay here in LA . 
--------------------
--------------------
She 's a bitch . 
- Danny , I will take care ... 
--------------------
--------------------
When you broke out , you isolated yourself . 
You 'll need help . 
--------------------
--------------------
- He 's gonna die . 
- We better hope he doesn 't . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry . 
We 're taking care of things here . 
--------------------
--------------------
Something 's wrong with the phones . 
The network 's been overloaded since news of the bomb broke . 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's the problem ? 
When I worked for Carrie over at Division , we were friends . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm so scared . 
It 's OK . 
--------------------
--------------------
We 're about to bomb the Middle East into next Wednesday . 
We 're supposed to be processing intel to support that . 
--------------------
--------------------
She sustained neurological damage . 
We won 't know the extent till we get her to the hospital . 
--------------------
--------------------
- I wouldn 't worry about it . 
Is it true ? 
--------------------
--------------------
God knows I hated doing it . 
But just as I suspected , he knew about the bomb . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'll lose my license 
I ... won 't make it 
--------------------
--------------------
Got hit by lightning at this age must 've done some bad things 
I 've done good deeds ! 
--------------------
--------------------
God will punish you for doing bad things 
I 've done good deeds ! 
--------------------
--------------------
It hurts 
Your determination can 't last 3 minutes 
--------------------
--------------------
Poor old man got stuck by lightning twice 
He probably won 't wake up again 
--------------------
--------------------
Cleaning all of them is too much work , trying to kill me ? 
You clean up your own spots ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Terrible , more ribs are cracked 
He should let the guy rest in peace 
--------------------
--------------------
He really won 't give up until the corpse is destroyed 
He should at least show respect for the family 
--------------------
--------------------
Your condition worries me more ! 
You may not feel any pain 
--------------------
--------------------
He has heartbeat but there is heart failure 
He needs heart transplant now or he won 't make it ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Bad liver , kidneys and lung 
Do we have healthy heart , liver and lung ? 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's really not that easy to be a nurse ! 
I won the lottery with the highest prize money in the history ! 
--------------------

It’ s all because of that bastard . 
Women who have good jobs should stay single like me . 
--------------------
--------------------
There’ s no need to worry . 
It’ s delicious . 
--------------------
--------------------
You could ruin our mother- daughter relationship .

If you fail this time , there 's always next year . 
I 'll do my best , Dad .

Sooner or later I 'll get a job , so don 't be so angry . 
You think I can help it ?

The accident was caused by Mr. Hwang 's car ? 
Yes , it 's true . 
--------------------
--------------------
What , the car caused the accident ? 
Sir , I 'll pull the horse until my father gets better . 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's so unfair . 
The powerful helping the helpless , isn 't that social justice ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You fraud , bully ! 
I won 't let you get away with this ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Aren 't you being too harsh on a weak lady ? 
Why do you care ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Did my son do anything wrong ? 
Yes , last night this student stole a woman 's purse . 
--------------------
--------------------
What about the pain medication ? 
My mom 's getting it from somewhere else , but thanks for trying . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Poor Bill .

You have to play fair

He hits me every time he gets drunk - is it ugly ? 
I think they 're cute 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's wrong with you today ? 
You won 't understand 
--------------------
--------------------
If the gas station goes bankrupt - It 'll be my fault 
Luckily I have my hands and feet to depend on myself 
--------------------
--------------------
Not bad 
That 's good 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'll be damned if you hurt me again 
You should have taken care of it yourself 
--------------------
--------------------
Idiot ! 
She slapped me because she 's in love with me

Liar !

I am an old man not as strong as before

They even killed Kim Ku , and I couldn 't die when I should have 
Since then , I lived each day hoping it 'll be my last

It 's too damn dull 
Still , Mr. Wang 's the only one to treat us with dignity

He 's also very sick , and he 's not himself 
You shouldn 't have saved him without any authorization 
--------------------
--------------------
Idiot ! 
Oh , Kaneko- san , it 's an honor for me , Minami 
--------------------
--------------------
But it 's true that terrorism has no place here anymore 
I devoted my whole life to it 
--------------------
--------------------
If you fall , then you lose 
What if I win ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Dol- Suk and I will attack first with pistols 
If we succeed , then we can all safely go to Inchon 
--------------------
--------------------
Even after their death , they could not return home . 
They failed , but they were still heroes ... 
--------------------
--------------------
- What a shame . 
Wow . 
--------------------

The one affrights you , the other makes you proud . 
--------------------
--------------------
Who deserves greatness deserves your hate 
Trust ye ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'd revolt only to make my wars with him . 
He is a lion that I am proud to hunt . 
--------------------
--------------------
The present wars devour him . 
He is grown too proud to be so valiant . 
--------------------
--------------------
But had he died in the business , madam , how then ? 
Then his good report should have been my son . 
--------------------
--------------------
I sometime lay here in Corioli at a poor man 's house . 
He used me kindly . 
--------------------
--------------------
I will make much of your voices , and so trouble you no further . 
The gods give you joy , sir , heartily . 
--------------------
--------------------
Bastards and all . 
Good man . 
--------------------
--------------------
Your enemies and his find something in him . 
We are all undone , unless the noble man have mercy . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , in such a case the gods will not be good unto us . 
When we banished him , we respected not them . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Measureless liar ! 
Thou hast made my heart too great for what contains it . 
--------------------
--------------------
No outrage . 
The man is noble and his fame folds- in this orb o ' the earth . 
--------------------
--------------------
Stupid , you are comparing this a bject girl with your mother . 
You are comparing religion and love , Babu- ji . 
--------------------
--------------------
And for that Lord one man has died while trying to kill him . 
That 's nice you come . 
--------------------
--------------------
But that door isn 't here which was disturbing you .

Good- bye , Hollywood !

A bad start , Desi . 
A clever ape only gives her male the right to mate with her . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're wrong , Paulina Orozco . 
I won 't need you . 
--------------------

I 've misunderstood you or you 've misunderstood me . 
I understood you perfectly , Desi , and you , me .

He was just a good lay .

Look , my friends .

How long have you been sleeping with this bitch ? 
You 're unbearable , Desi , darling . 
--------------------

Let me fake it . 
Thanks for holding my hand at the funeral .

--------------------
There will be no difficulty . 
Thanks , Walter .

Found it at a crash site . 
So is all true . 
--------------------
--------------------
She stopped us , she stopped us and let time keep moving . 
She wanted to keep us safe , and she did that . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm very , very scared . 
Just how powerful is this little girl , doctor ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I was afraid they 'd hurt other people . 
You 're one brave little girl . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , it wouldn 't make me sad at all . 
It would be nice to remember her . 
--------------------
--------------------
But no problem , right ? 
We 're the best . 
--------------------
--------------------
This isn 't getting too scary , is it ? 
Is good . 
--------------------
--------------------
I live on bad coffee and stale Oreos from the vending machine . 
THERESA : thank God you 're on the air . 
--------------------
--------------------
Come out and kill me already . 
I don 't care . 
--------------------
--------------------
At the crash site . 
I never thought your dad was all that bright . 
--------------------
--------------------
Is it dead ? 
Interesting choice of words . 
--------------------
--------------------
I know she 's dead . 
I don 't care . 
--------------------
--------------------
You want to know what scared me so badly ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm scared . 
Sweetheart ... 
--------------------

Let me help you . 
--------------------
--------------------
Driver was killed instantly . 
Two boys in the back pretty banged up . 
--------------------
--------------------
You can do that , no matter how bad it is . 
You can always make it better . 
--------------------
--------------------
The rash . 
It 's shaped like a hand . 
--------------------
--------------------
Do they wanna destroy the planet ? 
Save us from ourselves ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Your old man 's been dead , what , ten years now ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , it 's not like that at all . 
I 'll have you back by 2 : 00 in the morning , spook 's honour . 
--------------------
--------------------
What in the hell makes you think he 's not lying to you ? ! 
You don 't respect anything at all , do you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
' cause they had a haunted house there . 
It was so cool . 
--------------------
--------------------
Your father always hated this music . 
Anything that was popular while he was away . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 've been abducted by aliens . 
You think I care about your little toy trumpet ? 
--------------------
--------------------
And that 's what he was thinking when he died . 
I just wish I could see him one more time . 
--------------------
--------------------
Lisa was helpless . 
Allie can take care of herself . 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's wrong ? 
Where were you , sweetie ?

This place is totally harsh , so I 'm gonna make a suggestion . 
You wanna be friends ?

You 're getting really good on those drums . 
--------------------

How the hell you been , man ? 
Good .

They were in his pockets when he died . 
Your grandfather was a hero , Charlie , just like your dad .

It was the most scared he 'd ever been in his life . 
Yeah , yeah . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're no worse than the rest of us . 
Thanks , I guess .

--------------------
They don 't want to hurt anybody . 
They saved you .

That , my son and heir , is one hell of a whopper , isn 't it ? 
Super weapon or saviour , take your pick . 
--------------------
--------------------
He found it at a crash site . 
So it 's all true . 
--------------------
--------------------
Before he died , 
I think my father got a better look at me . 
--------------------
--------------------
You don 't waste any time , do you ? 
She 's clearly important . 
--------------------
--------------------
Capulet 's daughter , sworn enemy of her family . 
Slave of a passion growing in his heart ,

Cobuz 's Death . 
This is the music that I like !

--------------------
- No harm in giving them a decent send- off . 
I only hope a cheery soul will do this for me when my time comes .

A matter of hours affer the last attack . 
The virtue of surprise .

--------------------
Jealous . 
Ambitious .

I thought Sawyer was a bastard . 
A friendly word of advice , Styles .

No doubt . 
Stand clear !

Placing their lives in jeopardy . 
But the end result was a triumph .

Styles , keep that head of yours out of trouble .

--------------------
A guy got killed at the prison yesterday . 
Totally unrelated but still , security is tight . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry about it . 
In a couple months , we won 't even be working together . 
--------------------
--------------------
Not as mad as I 'd be ifI was the one who got shot . 
I respect your honesty . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm thinking abouthow screwed I am . 
All right , well, what about a cash advance on a credit card ? 
--------------------

Do I looklike a hero to you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Now we need to goto the road , steal another car . 
Really, couldn 't be happier . 
--------------------

--------------------
--------------------

Did you alone win all these cups and shields ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Have shame ! 
The loyal and eflicient workers of Verma Constructions . 
--------------------
--------------------
lf I disturb his penance ... ? 
I 'll throw a grand party for you and your friends ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Othe_ ise a man like you only deserves pity not love ! 
You snubbed a pretty girl like me ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm ashamed of your condition . 
Feel like drowning myself ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Why did you get beaten up ? 
You won 't understand . 
--------------------
--------------------
That gangster was troubling her . 
I thought you 'd be happy we could help somebody . 
--------------------
--------------------
lf you know Sagar , why did you abuse him in my shop ? 
I wanted to test the limits of your love . 
--------------------
--------------------
Lightning struck there but my nest was destroyed ! 
The ship of hope was almost ashore . 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's his problem ? 
About 4 years ago his beloved promised to meet him here . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Don 't worry about me . 
My work is my worship ( Pooja ) and worship is my work ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- Sad part ? 
- Feel proud of him ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- What could be your problem ? 
- I 'll tell you if you sit in peace . 
--------------------
--------------------
What a fraud ! 
You know how much Akash and Pooja love each other . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Cheating . 
Who knows for the love of what he kept serving me unlabeled wine . 
--------------------
--------------------
lf not love , we can share pain . 
I wish you could understand . 
--------------------
--------------------
I kept getting cheated and you quietly watched the show ! 
Not only watched , you auctioned my love in the market place ! 
--------------------
--------------------
What did you get by lying ? 
Your rich friend 's applause ? 
--------------------
--------------------
ls that why whatever you did so far was a lie , a deception ? 
Was the claim to love Pooja a drama ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I 've been made to stand in the bar of suspicion and disgrace ! 
lf I knew I would have to face this day for your friendship ... 
--------------------
--------------------
The carriage lies broken at the edge of the abyss . 
But she who had only stood by her beloved brother , was saved ... 
--------------------
--------------------
- That 's a shame . 
He 's so cute . 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's too bad . 
Well , Bonnie , how do you like your steak ? 
--------------------
--------------------
No wonder he went nuts . 
- You better take that to the hospital . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Don 't worry about it . 
He 's good . 
--------------------
--------------------
I know what it means , but I 'd rather be broke . 
I don 't care whether we get that contract or not . 
--------------------
--------------------
Not a bad idea . 
Make you a present of the profit . 
--------------------
--------------------
Your neck 's broken , Kid . 
Funny . 
--------------------
--------------------
The next morning , the general assault began . 
At noon , Mahomet made a triumphant entry into the city . 
--------------------
--------------------
But she had not passed a single day upon her sad return . 
But my love never dies . 
--------------------
--------------------
Ready to kill more Germans ? 
Yes , sir . 
--------------------
--------------------
Say 5 % killed by our own barrage . 
That 's a very generous allowance . 
--------------------
--------------------
We went to school together before the war . 
He thinks I don 't have enough respect for him . 
--------------------
--------------------
Were you in the first wave during the attack on the Ant Hill ? 
Yes , sir . 
--------------------
--------------------
- The prisoner will reply to the question . 
- Yes , sir . 
--------------------
--------------------
Are you protesting the authenticity of this court ? 
Yes , sir . 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's an error , my son . 
God is always ready to listen to your prayers . 
--------------------
--------------------
Many of us 'll join you before this war 's over . 
I don 't care . 
--------------------
--------------------
I don 't wanna die . 
- Please save me , Sergeant . 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , Father , I 'm scared . 
Courage . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fire ! 
I 'm awfully glad you could be there , George . 
--------------------
--------------------
France cannot afford to have fools guiding her military destiny . 
I 'm grateful to you for bringing the matter to my attention . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , I haven 't even broken 13 seconds ... 
I wish I could run as fast as you , Amano . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't regret saying that . 
Thank you ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Really scared ! 
The least you could do is say " thanks , " all right ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Keep an eye on the prisoner . 
Yes , sir ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Pathetic . 
Sounds like an interesting guy . 
--------------------
--------------------
Scared of finding out that he really abandon us . 
Perhaps , deep down , I didn 't want to accept that . 
--------------------
--------------------
Not bad ! 
Well played , Freid ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Damn it ... 
I 'll have my fun later ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Give us the word to attack ! 
That won 't be necessary . 
--------------------
--------------------
You bald bastards ! 
See ifwe care when Zaibach burns this place down ! 
--------------------
--------------------
The city seems kind of lonely ... 
I wonder if the people here in Zaibach are really happy . 
--------------------
--------------------
The war was over before he even got there . 
Thank God for that . 
--------------------
--------------------
No syphilis , nothing like that ? 
So as far as you know ... ... you have good semen ? 
--------------------
--------------------
The " I can 'ts " destroyed us ! 
I 'm going to make us strong again . 
--------------------
--------------------
Take that damn shirt off , Johnny ! 
I managed to save these . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 've got an attack to coordinate . 
They 've asked me to negotiate a peace treaty . 
--------------------
--------------------
This was all a misunderstanding . 
I appreciate your offer , Mr. Postman . 
--------------------
--------------------
Or I could think of worse company . 
Perfect ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I don 't give a damn what that asshole said . 
The general is a great man ! 
--------------------
--------------------
No more killing . 
There 's going to be peace ! 
--------------------
--------------------
With no regrets . 
And so , in honor of my father ... . 
--------------------
--------------------
I want to stay sick . 
I 'm in love , really , really in love . 
--------------------
--------------------
But we have to fight , and we will fight ! 
It 's the only way to break our chains and set ourselves free !

Where the fuck my money ? 
Beautiful guitar , it 's yours .

I thought I could never love it better than I did . 
But , oh , glory ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- When he says death , death it is . 
- The true God says life . 
--------------------
--------------------
Traitors and fools ! 
You" il wish this was better done .

You were willing to let him go to his death alone . 
Why should you help him now he doesn" t need you ?

Saint- Avit , for his part , was beginning to lose patience .

" I will kill your friend before your eyes ! "

but Satanas , the fallen angel , whose whole heart was set -

This period of terror so brutalized the human mind -

My child , I am too old to tell lies . 
Yes , I am the countess de chambord , -

Of the miserable clothes left to Marie Antoinette , - 
- at one time the most beautiful lady in France , - 
--------------------
--------------------
Now she is being prepared for death out there . 
Is that good enough for you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
In the agony of despair , Satanas pauses in his wanderings , - 
- which , paved as they are with dashed hopes , - 
--------------------
--------------------
- but even the worst of sinners has a claim - 
- to be comforted by religion . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's a common rash , sometimes brought on by heat and stress . 
Just try to relax . 
--------------------
--------------------
And all the pain will stop . 
Your Shiite friends have already implicated you in the bombing .

Still lying .

He 's already weak .

You 're lying . 
You can 't help anyone .

Now , Chicken is so great ! 
--------------------

You failed ten times ! 
But luckily you come to me . 
--------------------
--------------------
And after a series of threats and warnings he starts to beat me . 
O Allah , most gracious , most merciful . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's upsetting to hear that , isn 't it ? 
Everyone knows you were better than her . 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , she has some personal problems . 
What kind ? 
--------------------
--------------------
The team is in terrible shape . 
And the young players don 't have that winning edge . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no , no ... 
I 'll ask the association if they can help you . 
--------------------
--------------------
This tired soul is heading home ... 
Good luck . 
--------------------
--------------------
Hey , if your back isn 't killing you , then get up ! 
How will you win the gold ? ! 
--------------------
--------------------
What the hell did you say ? ! 
You said you heard me loud and clear ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Would you reject a male coach if he had a divorce ? 
I don 't care who you choose as the new coach . 
--------------------
--------------------
Coach , don 't worry about us . 
If you win the gold medal , it 'll feel like we won it , too . 
--------------------
--------------------
What the hell is going on ? 
You probably know better than to drink medicinal herbs . 
--------------------
--------------------
So did you pay for the damages ? 
Yes , Coach . 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's nonsense . 
Respect the game for what it is . 
--------------------
--------------------
I don 't know why I got so stressed out before . 
It 's nice to coach kid in a small town . 
--------------------
--------------------
As I recall , you were extremely jealous of Mi- sook ! 
That was true back then . 
--------------------
--------------------
You son of a bitch . 
I hope you win that damn gold medal ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Hey , don 't worry . 
You 're Korea 's best goalkeeper . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't get hurt ! 
- We 're going to win , right ! 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no , no ! 
It touched her hand when it went out of bounds ! 
--------------------
--------------------
They say that wrong calls are a part of the game . 
In Europe , the Denmark team are the favorites . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's strange place to see the New Year in , here among the dead . 
You gentlemen are not afraid of ghosts , surely ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Go to bed , you are tired . 
I will take care of this . 
--------------------

--------------------
" No . ... no ... 
I am ... not a murderer . "

For the first time , we saw two of the savages . 
They seemed to be trusting .

A man of insolent character , Denpachiro took the loss badly . 
The proud winner treated him with contempt .

His desire for revenge and his ill will dyed the night black . 
Who should happen to pass by but Sozaemon , in a good mood . 
--------------------
--------------------
We 've fallen on hard times . 
Please , help us out .

All pointing to her violent nature , sir john . 
Yes , but that was not altogether borne out by fame .

I 'd rather be deaf than blind , wouldn 't you ? 
I can see you 'd be nice company . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're on the wrong road . 
There 's only more farms like ours that way ... 
--------------------
--------------------
You 'll lose that boat if you don 't watch out . 
That 's great . 
--------------------
--------------------
I guess I got the wrong model . 
I 've got a better idea . 
--------------------
--------------------
Stop , stop , you 're breaking my heart . 
And the picture he 's painting , he 's gonna call it Hope . 
--------------------
--------------------
I hate him . 
I wish I 'd never met him . 
--------------------

Now , stop the crying . 
Am I good- looking ? 
--------------------

Don 't you worry about that . 
I wish I were being born this morning .

I wonder if you 'll be kind enough to let me tell you my side .

A million girls would kill for this job . 
It sounds like a great opportunity .

She sent me dirty , tired and paunchy .

That is a pathetic excuse .

Don 't get upset , honey , they 're just plain jerks . 
My conditions for learning weren 't too helpful .

--------------------
Some local dipshit . 
That was good . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's lying here on a bench . 
We are with him , with a friend of mine . 
--------------------
--------------------
I found that crime don 't pay . 
Now I 'm happy in the light and love the whole world .

A prisoner ? 
You see , we 're , well - We 're engaged .

Gee , Steve , that was wrong . 
Well , anyway , he 's grown up to be a fine young boy .

Don 't worry about Frosby . 
He 'll be taken care of .

I 'm really quite upset . 
I do appreciate the courtesy .

No , no , no . 
Nothing nearly as grand , Lieutenant . 
--------------------
--------------------
Poor Bertie did . 
Well , I 'll tell you , that 's a relief to hear . 
--------------------

That 's a long time to hang around after you just killed a man . 
Yes , a logical question .

No , no . 
I 'd be delighted .

There 's a suicide clause in the policy . 
If I can ever be of any help ... 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm terribly sorry . 
I enjoyed it . 
--------------------
--------------------
I owe it to myself to express my dissatisfaction . 
I was clearly in line for the position that you gave George . 
--------------------
--------------------
I have been betrayed , pursued , and threatened by innuendo . 
The least I could hope for is some understanding from my wife . 
--------------------
--------------------
My problem is just the opposite . 
Born smart , as they say . 
--------------------
--------------------
Now the killer knows when the record will end . 
Yes , yes , you 've demonstrated all that . 
--------------------
--------------------
We can go directly to the more difficult questions . 
Ah , yes , here we are . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's pathetic enough as it is ! 
Oh , wow , Sammy , maybe you 're right .

I have the most awful suspicion 
Tell me , on your word of honor , are you a hairdresser ? 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's gonna give you trouble . 
Well , I hope it isn 't gonna be one of those marathon games .

Porter , Hel could 've killed me if she wanted to . 
I 'm not their prisoner .

It 's hopeless ... perhaps by tomorrow ... no longer . 
I 'm so glad you came , Abe .

I know , Billie , but it 's a pity to fool her . 
And she 's a fine woman , smart as pepper and pretty too .

That 's too bad . 
Nice trip ?

Too bad . 
- Smells good .

Yes , I 'd have been particular about some of her friends .

Don 't worry about it , really .

Mr. Dumontier , please don 't get excited . 
--------------------
--------------------
You don 't have to worry about me . 
I will take good care of me . 
--------------------
--------------------
Aren 't you ashamed ? 
Oh yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Jailed ... 
For heaven 's sake , where 's my passport ? 
--------------------
--------------------
And don 't worry about the critics . 
Just trust Colwyn and his connections . 
--------------------
--------------------
Tired . 
No brilliance . 
--------------------
--------------------
stop that damned singing ! stop it ! 
Good God , Albert , what 's the matter ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm starved . 
Good evening , ladies . 
--------------------
--------------------
- That 's awful . 
- Such a pretty name . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry , Frau Schlotterbeck . 
I 'll take care of that . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Nonsense ! 
- You 'll see , the engagement will break up . 
--------------------
--------------------
Terrible . 
Good God , what will be the outcome ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Your father hates all this publicity . 
Congratulations . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's killed her ! 
--- I 'll go for help ! 
--------------------
--------------------
The attacker left footprints , you see 
Very clear . 
--------------------
--------------------
The killer stole them to throw suspicion on this poor fellow . 
Oh , thank you , sir ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You want to destroy me ! 
--- I want to save you ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Since this outrageous attack I haven 't seen Mile Stangerson . 
I wish to see her ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I mean , no – no , it wasn 't me ! 
Yes , yes , just a moment Thank you , officers 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm just tired this evening 
I hope Mile Stangerson is feeling better 
--------------------
--------------------
Arrested ? 
My God , my God ! 
--------------------
--------------------
He has confessed that he attacked you 
But he 's innocent ! 
--------------------
--------------------
He is incapable of killing the gamekeeper . 
He would never kill ... we love each other 
--------------------
--------------------
For weeks you have been too ill for Mr. Larsan 's interrogation 
I would like him to question you on certain points . 
--------------------
--------------------
I will have him arrested at once ! 
Justice will not be mocked ! 
--------------------
--------------------
The night before the crime , probably . 
This is no joke , Your Honor 
--------------------
--------------------
Larsan is dead . 
Rouletabille is right – he was smarter than all of you . 
--------------------
--------------------
I alone killed the gamekeeper 
Yes , he caught me , the night when I drugged the wine 
--------------------
--------------------
Died . 
I would like to go , please . 
--------------------
--------------------
What could have caused the death of Louis . 
Why I did not die ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Sorry if annoying . 
I watch a while and I say that I find wonderful . 
--------------------
--------------------
Because women fear will ... impaired children to face life . 
- Is it true ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- You scared me - Return late . 
- Wait , I 'll help . 
--------------------
--------------------
" Pregnant women are your weakness ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
I sucked everything ! 
Like your brother ! 
--------------------
--------------------
No wonder you do poor business ! 
Don 't look at me like that ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Bad blood ? 
Well , that happens in the best families ! 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's wrong with the guy ? 
Have a drink , my dear colleague ! 
--------------------
--------------------
After all , professor , you can 't blame the problem , can you ? 
As a man of honor , I 'd better leave ... 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't be sad ! 
Be like me ! 
--------------------
--------------------
some crazy ideas about her job ! 
Good evening . 
--------------------
--------------------
Who gives a damn ? 
Cheers , Teach . 
--------------------
--------------------
Her temper hasn 't grown any sweeter with time . 
You 've been enjoying life . 
--------------------
--------------------
No wonder you do poor business ! 
Don 't look at me like that ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Bad blood ? 
Well , that happens in the best families ! 
--------------------

Have a drink , my dear colleague ! 
--------------------
--------------------

Because this is dangerous country , and anything might happen . 
- You wouldn 't care . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry . 
It 's Black Elk and some of his braves . 
--------------------
--------------------
We 're building a nation , so we 've got to suffer . 
No great trail was ever blazed without hardship . 
--------------------
--------------------
- You can 't do this awful thing ... take two lives ! 
It 's frontier justice . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 'll be froze to death in an hour . 
It may help me .

Those women must be mad .

Not badly written for a soldier

No official injury signs , if we 're wounded .

--------------------
--------------------
Anyone can see with half an eye that there 's something wrong . 
And I 've two eyes , and pretty good ones at that . 
--------------------
--------------------
- What do you mean , " no trouble " ? 
There 's nothing but trouble . 
--------------------
--------------------
This stuff 's wasted on 'em . 
Well , well , well . 
--------------------
--------------------
You look so tired . 
- If I could just save us from it . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's maddening . 
Easy , old man . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fire ! 
Help ! 
--------------------
--------------------
But still , I worry . 
I can 't help it . 
--------------------
--------------------
And you really believe that you can bring life to the dead ? 
That body is not dead . 
--------------------

Fire ! 
Help ! 
--------------------
--------------------
She 's sick . 
We 'll take care of you . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry about them . 
They eat out of my hand . 
--------------------
--------------------
In fact , a more poisonous little barbecue I 've never attended . 
You 're a funny kind of a duck , but I like you . 
--------------------
--------------------
- No fooling ? 
- Yes , a roving commission . 
--------------------
--------------------
Mr. Oxly , that may be dangerous . 
I 'm perfectly willing to take that chance . 
--------------------
--------------------
- No , no , Gus . 
- Yes ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , it even makes the water taste bitter . 
Well , better put these away . 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , what a shame . 
Then pour yourself into that new dress , and we 'll go celebrate . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm liable to knock somebody 's block off . 
Yes , dear . 
--------------------
--------------------
Why are you crying ? 
I can 't help it . 
--------------------
--------------------
Now , it 's all my fault . 
- I won 't let you forgive him . 
--------------------
--------------------
So then you are angry . 
Oh , I 've been in better moods . 
--------------------
--------------------
Aversion to you ? 
Well , I love you , you potato head . 
--------------------
--------------------
What a fool I was to let you take that stuff last night . 
- Well , you couldn 't help it . 
--------------------
--------------------
Barnaby , when we get mad , we don 't fight , do we ? 
- Yes , we do . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no , no . 
I want her to stay and play with me . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no , I don 't want it . 
Well , would you like a new bicycle or a pony ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Now , Mrs. Fulton , don 't cry . 
Remember , you are the wife of a great scientist . 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , poor Barnaby . 
He was so brilliant . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'll be dead . 
Yes , and when he 's 20 , think how old I 'll be . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 've made him cry . 
That 's all right , darling . 
--------------------
--------------------
- He 's probably tired and sleepy . 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
She 's sick . 
We 'll take care of you . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry about them . 
They eat out of my hand .

Had me arrested ! 
You are a clever woman , and a very loyal one . 
--------------------
--------------------
Not bad . 
But I think we 'd better start on the champagne . 
--------------------
--------------------
We fly or are killed . 
How about that kiss , lady ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You trick men into death with your body . 
Give me a kiss . 
--------------------
--------------------
Does the attack begin on the ninth ? 
Yes , at five o 'clock in the morning . 
--------------------
--------------------
Not a bad death , to die for my country . 
It 's better than gas or the river . 
--------------------
--------------------
You have no fear of this death ? 
It 's only another exciting adventure .

My father is dead , and you killed him ! 
You crucified him just as surely as he was crucified . 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , what makes you think I 'm discouraged ? 
I know what would cheer you up : 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's dead drunk . 
Hallelujah ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Hate ! 
But here within , there is a heartbeat of love . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm crazy about you when you 're mad , baby . 
You look more beautiful . 
--------------------
--------------------
The trouble with you , Welford , is you 're too mercenary . 
Now , come on over to my joint and meet some carnival cuties .

Don 't worry , Dink . 
We 'll have a lot of fun from now on .

--------------------
I don 't want any trouble at home ... ... and I 'm not interested 
Such crass pleasures are beneath you . 
--------------------
--------------------
That wasn 't my fault . 
How handsome my Alexis was in his dress uniform . 
--------------------
--------------------
It doesn 't disgust me as with old Marchal . 
He was the hot- blooded kind . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fearing a violent scene , the lady called for help . 
Fortunately , both her husband and I are peaceful men . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don’ t get mad … he did say nothing . 
No … but I got an idea he was laughing at us all the time . 
--------------------
--------------------
You’ re a bitch . 
You lick the hand that feeds you … the hand that beats you too . 
--------------------
--------------------
He has no heart … no upbringing . 
Lucienne … you don’ t love me anymore ? 
--------------------
--------------------
What about this white slavery business ? 
Oh , not white slavery !

Poor busy man , doesn 't know what the modern girl should wear .

He worries me . 
Oh , yes , darling , yes , it 's a lovely day . 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , no , no . 
They 're my friends . 
--------------------
--------------------
Frightened ? 
No , I love it . 
--------------------
--------------------
- No , no . 
Nothing of that kind . 
--------------------
--------------------
- It 's madness , nothing else . 
- Listen , sweetheart . 
--------------------
--------------------
No arrests . 
That 's lucky . 
--------------------
--------------------
But you 've hurt me too . 
Yesterday , you won your first case in five months . 
--------------------
--------------------
And if I fall and get hurt , why , I 'll pick myself up again . 
But , Jan , darling , this isn 't love . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's got a lot of ideas and they 're all bad . 
Why , he 's sweet . 
--------------------
--------------------
Just too bad . 
Why , the way I love you , there 's nothing left to think about . 
--------------------
--------------------
In case I die , I wanted to see you . 
Any reason 's good . 
--------------------
--------------------
But you can 't really frighten me , Ace . 
[ ACE LAUGHS ] 
--------------------
--------------------
You ought to hate me . 
I wish you did . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Oh , no , no . 
- Yes , yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
On the day of the killing , did you see Ace Wilfong ? 
- Yes , I did . 
--------------------
--------------------
- He 'd been very brutal the night before ... 
- I object , Your Honor .

Administration of Tegel prison 
Good luck , Biberkopf . 
--------------------
--------------------
It was a tragic accident . 
You had a fractured skull and we couldn 't save your arm . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , I 'd rather be a thief . 
I did the best I could . 
--------------------
--------------------
- No no no no ! 
I did the best I could !

I tell you , women are trouble . 
But at home , I have a wonderful one .

Prison ! 
Yes , even Franz .

Stop Mieze , stop ! 
Promise that you won 't look behind that curtain !

Nothing wrong with that ? 
It 's a nice day and we will drive a bit around .

At least you can 't lose anything that way . 
Well , well .

Why so upset , Miss Cilly ? 
They just want to have a little fun .

Murderer ! 
Help !

Fifteen years ' prison for Reinhold . 
Pretty stiff . 
--------------------

And the third was mad about me 
And they had money and they were nice 
--------------------
--------------------
What an awful ladder ! 
Perhaps next time you might choose a nicer warehouse . 
--------------------
--------------------
This place is a pigsty , and this is a lousy stump ! 
There , my friend . 
--------------------
--------------------
There 's no man who 's bad enough 
Still it 's nice to watch them 
--------------------
--------------------
Good- bye , you poor fools . 
Good- bye , Captain ! 
--------------------
--------------------
They have hard hearts but weak nerves . 
Well , we won 't spare their nerves today !

There 's no man who 's bad enough 
Still it 's nice to watch them 
--------------------
--------------------
This slut is all I need now .

You 'll drive the man crazy ! 
Ah , Smith , my darling , I love you so .

Ah , Smith , my darling , I love you so .

I was only fooling , Frank . 
I 'm not really mad . 
--------------------
--------------------
Off your beaten path a bit tonight , aren 't you ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
I can 't imagine his ever regarding you as a burden . 
Only in Paris , I hope . 
--------------------
--------------------
I mean angry for seeing so little of what Paris really can be . 
I adore it so , don 't you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I wasn 't trying to fool you , Mary . 
I wish I were . 
--------------------
--------------------
It lies next to my property . 
It is a great pleasure to meet you , Count . 
--------------------
--------------------
lies in wait for the living . 
You can laugh as much as you want . 
--------------------
--------------------
Aren 't you ashamed of yourself ? 
Now , you are interested in spiders . 
--------------------
--------------------
A raving lunatic ! 
When beautiful and plump spiders are not available ... maybe . 
--------------------
--------------------
I am weak . 
You are strong . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fool . 
And I thought you were a wise man . 
--------------------
--------------------
Miss Eva ... over there ... dead . 
Thank God , she is still alive . 
--------------------
--------------------
Throw away that awful wreath of flowers , will you , Marta ? 
And please open the windows and let some fresh air in . 
--------------------
--------------------
It is useless . 
You 'll never harm that bat . 
--------------------
--------------------
Evil wiped out , eh ? 
You wanna take all the fun out of life ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- Now , it can 't be as bad as that . 
John , my good friend , I realize your Dr. Heath is right . 
--------------------
--------------------
- The big -- - Did he hurt you ? 
It 'll take more than a bloke like that to .... 
--------------------
--------------------
- After all , an ankle can be very painful . 
- You are ever so kind . 
--------------------
--------------------
That doesn 't hurt anymore , huh ?

If ever a man dared lay a hand to me like that , I 'd -- 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , you mustn 't look so worried . 
It won 't be for a long , long time . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're just nervous and jumpy , that 's all . 
- Yes , sir . 
--------------------
--------------------
I ain 't a bad looker when I 'm more myself . 
You liked me once a little , didn 't you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , but it confuses you , doesn 't it ? 
It isn 't quite clear , is it ? 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's wrong , sir ?

Might be something ... ... better than anything . 
--------------------
--------------------
How many different kinds of bacteria it will destroy . 
That way you will find out what it is good for . 
--------------------
--------------------
But you don 't mean that someone has stolen ... 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
No . sir . no . 
I am not going to fail you . 
--------------------
--------------------
Native population . plague raging . 
Ideal conditions . 
--------------------
--------------------
The worst- infected place in the entire colony . 
You 'll have plenty of opportunity here to do what you want . 
--------------------
--------------------
You try to save all these poor devils . 
Save all of them .

She 's dead . 
I thought she 'd be safe ! 
--------------------
--------------------
But she 's dead . 
We 'd better pick her up . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't forget that she is dead . 
Please , I thought I had a right to tell the truth ? 
--------------------
--------------------
He is ill and is in the hospital . 
Yes that 's right , he didn 't feel right ... 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no , nothing serious , just a small scratch . 
Yes , from the briefcase ... 
--------------------
--------------------
Accused of murdering Mrs. Moore because she didn 't deny it . 
And everyone is happy . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's gone crazy ! 
We better get down . 
--------------------
--------------------
But prison ... 
If you are my friend , do not attempt anything ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- Ah , looks bad . 
Yes , I already thought as much . 
--------------------
--------------------
Why do they write so boring novels . 
Is yours more fun ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Been bored long enough - Stop . 
Going to Monte Carlo to have some fun . 
--------------------
--------------------
Am I not your type , darling ? 
But of course , sweetie ... the whole body . 
--------------------
--------------------
Without that war paint , huh ? 
Yes ... 
--------------------
--------------------
What kind of dirty trick is this ! 
Well - we 've take care of this , eh ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Bloody stupid ! 
- Pretty ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- So you 're a criminal ! 
- Yes , could be ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- A robber ! 
- Yes , go on ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- A murderer , you ... 
- And you ... are beautiful . 
--------------------
--------------------
At 9 o 'clock sharp the first shot will be fired . 
Hooray ! 
--------------------
--------------------
With the new wall there 's no more danger . 
I hope it 's finished by morning . 
--------------------
--------------------
Hopeless . 
Well , have a nice trip . 
--------------------
--------------------
Fire ! 
Guys , let 's clear out ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Fire ! 
- Good- bye , Mama . 
--------------------
--------------------
Poor devils . 
Hey , you think they have enough rescue gear ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm sick and tired of your secrets . 
Good luck . 
--------------------
--------------------
- If anyone hears about this , we 'll get fired on the spot . 
You can stay if you like , dearest . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Don 't worry , fella . 
- We 'll take good care of you .

Five men trapped in the railcar room .

The World Crisis . 
I open the session and hand over to ... 
--------------------

The world 's nations are suffering under a crisis . 
You , happy Ostend , are getting married ! 
--------------------
--------------------
The World Crisis . 
I open the session and hand over to ... 
--------------------
--------------------
We 're facing a very grave problem . 
We 've been lucky so far . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Problems make you bankrupt . 
Comedies bring dividends .

The nations of this world are suffering under crisis . 
You , happy Ostend .

Bad Ostende . 
Grand Hotel . 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's wrong ? 
--- Nothing , dear ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I badly need to see him , and he didn 't come 
I promise --- Thank you ! 
--------------------
--------------------
For 10 years I 've searched for him in vain . 
I beg you to help me find my son . 
--------------------
--------------------
Look at the damage ! 
Good Lord , it 's flat ! 
--------------------
--------------------
My poor Mathilde ! 
--- Yes , quickly ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I believe that he is dead 
If your son was my friend , the one I told you about ... 
--------------------
--------------------
He wouldn 't have wanted to remind you of a husband you hated 
But you ... did you sometimes see your friend 's mother ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Aren 't you scared , Rouletabille ? 
It 's not the worst thing 
--------------------
--------------------
Defending against outside attacks 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
“ The Crime Dinner ” ! 
It 's very funny , right ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You were in the War ? 
Oh , yes , as a reporter ... 
--------------------
--------------------
One thing is proven : the killer is in the chateau 
And the chateau is hermetically sealed , like a safe

like a pack of nasty , starving wolves . 
What will save them ? 
--------------------
--------------------
They 've stolen my case ! 
Help ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Skilful fingers don 't cheat . 
- That 's great ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Ah , those bastards ! 
Good boys ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- I 'll show you how to cheat . 
- You 'd better look out ! 
--------------------
--------------------
He killed Snuffy ! 
Well , you sure made great use of your time ! 
--------------------
--------------------
So you girls got drunk ! 
Congratulations , boys ! 
--------------------

She 's threatening . 
Good heavens , for how long shall this go on !

Murder ! 
Help !

Murder ! 
Help !

The witness Scherr saw him at the hour of the crime . 
That 's great ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Of course he broke down immediately . 
Well , it might have been a surprise for him . 
--------------------
--------------------
Mella , my poor girl . 
Move over for mummy 's darling , will you ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Criminal Code 
Yes ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Klatte is lying . 
The story about the friend , that had been a lie ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm going crazy ! 
Baumann , help me ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- I hate it ? 
- Yes , own up . 
--------------------
--------------------
He hates to keep passengers waiting . 
Such a good lad . 
--------------------
--------------------
My poor Felicity . 
She always loved a party . 
--------------------
--------------------
- We must all die one day . 
When one isn 't rich , one has to work . 
--------------------
--------------------
Is that my fault ? 
I 'll give her everything she wants - money , jewels ... 
--------------------
--------------------
- He 's an idiot . 
And he won 't get the shop till his dad dies . 
--------------------
--------------------
Lunatics can be very dangerous . 
I know one who 'd love to hit you . 
--------------------
--------------------
Yet you weep over a boy who washes glasses . 
Well , if that 's what you want , I won 't stop you . 
--------------------
--------------------
Marius wants her to reject Panisse . 
Did he say he loved her ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't lose your temper , Norine . 
Maybe he doesn 't love her . 
--------------------
--------------------
Then why is he jealous of Panisse ? 
This should be easy to settle . 
--------------------
--------------------
You may find taller , bigger men , but none more handsome . 
Laugh if you like , but it 's the truth . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't make me angry . 
Just 'cause he 's handsome , does he have to marry a Rothschild ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't take me for an idiot . 
I know you love Fanny . 
--------------------
--------------------
I said you 're lying . 
You love Fanny . 
--------------------
--------------------
But I want to know why you 're being so stupid . 
You can 't love the girl . 
--------------------
--------------------
Sometimes I say you 'll be the death of me . 
It isn 't true . 
--------------------
--------------------
Every time you spoke to a girl , I wished she 'd drop dead . 
You were always in my dreams of the future . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's no use crying . 
It won 't change my mind . 
--------------------
--------------------
Loser pays for the drinks . 
Good night , Monsieur César . 
--------------------
--------------------
I had no intention of insulting the navy . 
I admire the French navy . 
--------------------
--------------------
You admit you 're cheating ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'll never trust a Marseillais again . 
I need more courage to stay than go . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't cry into the croissants . 
That won 't help matters . 
--------------------
--------------------
Stop crying . 
You trust me , don 't you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's bad for your health . 
You don 't look too good . 
--------------------
--------------------
- I hate it ? 
- Yes , own up .

I have looked for work everywhere , but without success . 
Courage , Okajima ! 
--------------------
--------------------
No mistake about it . 
It 's gone for good . 
--------------------
--------------------
But it was worthless . 
This man was wearing a superb jacket . 
--------------------
--------------------
But Michel 's in trouble , so he 'll get whatever I give him . 
It all depends on how generous I want to be . 
--------------------
--------------------
O pity , see how I grieve 
Yes , great is my adversity 
--------------------
--------------------
The troubles I 've had over that ! 
Look , sir , you promised to help me .

It 's just a little good- luck charm I carry around with me .

It was stolen on the north side tonight . 
Oh , I got a good cafe business .

Don 't worry .

You 're going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer from now on . 
I should hope not . 
--------------------
--------------------
Think that one over , sucker . 
That doesn 't make any difference if they love each other . 
--------------------
--------------------
It looks rotten . 
Gallagher , do you look good ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I failed ? 
Well , that 's funny . 
--------------------
--------------------
That was kind of a rotten thing to do , Anne . 
After all , Gallagher is my friend . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Not bad . 
Not good , but not bad . 
--------------------
--------------------
You ought to be able to fool almost anybody . 
Well , have you seen enough , or would you like a photograph ? 
--------------------
--------------------
What are you crying about ? 
Is it true , Stewart ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- I poisoned him . 
Stop trying to be funny and get ready , will you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- It 's haunted j ust the same . 
- Yes , sir . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 'll find him at Joe 's , no doubt . 
Yeah , Hank would be my idea of a perfect bodyguard . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 've been a fool all my life . 
I 've always loved you . 
--------------------
--------------------
Last year the economic crisis was hard , 
I don 't know if the company will pay the bonus . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's sad to think that we no longer will be companions . 
Next year , when you 're promoted , you 'll be facing the public . 
--------------------
--------------------
For us the times ahead are very difficult . 
You are in luck , there 's a job for you . 
--------------------
--------------------
Liar ! 
I 'm not scared of you ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I was right , but of course he fired me . 
Be a good boy and play with this , okay ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Hasn 't this been forbidden to her ? 
- Certainly ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- but that 's not true . 
I wish I hadn 't started any business with the Czar ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Say , aren 't you ashamed ? - ashamed ? 
I 'm proud . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't trouble yourself . 
I 'll take care of everything : 
--------------------
--------------------
Hasn 't this been forbidden to her ? 
- Certainly ! 
--------------------
--------------------
For the bomb- thrower , your Majesty . 
Your Majesty , she 's a such good girl , such a pretty girl . 
--------------------
--------------------
Sit down , you stupid dog ! 
If you 're in love and don 't know where to go 
--------------------
--------------------
The girl was completely mad about the little father , the Czar . 
He kissed her when they parted ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't trouble yourself . 
I 'll take care of everything : 
--------------------
--------------------
You are an idiot ! 
- Yes sir . 
--------------------
--------------------
Are you angry with me ? " Oh ! 
" One day I have had a dream , you were going to make me happy . 
--------------------
--------------------
Anybody sitting next to you could be the murderer . " 
Yes , that 's very true . 
--------------------
--------------------
You make me puke ! 
Shoddy work , my friend . 
--------------------
--------------------
He must be killed , eliminated , exterminated ! 
Without mercy or compassion ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Piles of letters full of the most outrageous slander ! 
Very true . 
--------------------
--------------------
And then a voice cries out , and I can 't listen anymore ! 
Help ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- Ridiculous ! 
- You mean this monster should go free ? 
--------------------
--------------------
ln fact , I regret it . 
My dear hostess , what a dinner ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Are you so mad about that name ? 
It 's pretty : 
--------------------
--------------------
Maybe I 'm wrong . 
It 's better than Romaine ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I hate sacrifices . 
But in the future I 'll thank you to give a thought to my pride . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 'll get no argument from me . 
So pretty ... that childish charm ... 
--------------------
--------------------
And she 's a riot . 
At a party she 's unbeatable . 
--------------------
--------------------
And our cigars are awful . 
Care for a cigarette ? 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's a bad habit . 
He 's earned his fame . 
--------------------
--------------------
His worry was how not to have any ! 
Dear Manichette ! 
--------------------
--------------------
She wasn 't cruel . 
But was she ever lovely ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Poor Zambeaux ! 
And the gent 's lady friend ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I feared that cup of vitriol . 
As I played my piece , as my hands played it , 
--------------------
--------------------
At the sight of this woman , so moved , exhausted , 
looking at me adoringly , 
--------------------
--------------------
She 's so shy ! 
You 'd certainly be safe taking her to Havana . 
--------------------
--------------------
This one 's broken . 
You won 't forget ... 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm so stupid . lnnocent as a baby . 
I was funny last night , eh ? 
--------------------
--------------------
But you seem so sad sometimes . 
' Cause you stopped loving her ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Let 's say I 'm the lowest of the low . 
Well , let 's play . 
--------------------
--------------------
We 're tired , that 's all . 
We make love too much . 
--------------------
--------------------
Awful ? 
You triumphed everywhere . 
--------------------
--------------------
It was stupid . 
I 'm not afraid to die anymore . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm sick of music . 
Good music . 
--------------------
--------------------
" I 'm very tired , Pierrot . 
" I kiss your big , trusting eyes . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's surely a case of ... a neurotic crisis . 
Thanks . 
--------------------
--------------------
Candy , a toy , and fruit can be the murderer 's weapons 
True , true ! 
--------------------
--------------------
It would be better if you got the murderer 
Yes ! 
--------------------
--------------------
This is wrecking our business , Sarge , trouble every night 
You can 't have ten minutes peace anymore . 
--------------------
--------------------
Just a pile of letters with the most incredible accusations ! 
Quite true 
--------------------
--------------------
The day Elsie Beckmann was killed , someone bought a balloon 
He was with a little girl and he whistled just like that ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Damn carelessness , all that trouble for one door 
Yes , good 
--------------------
--------------------
Of course , something was stolen . 
ln fact , a good deal 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's the murder squad want ? 
Yes , old boy , your case has been passed over to me now 
--------------------
--------------------
- The one that went bankrupt ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
But if you kill me , it 'll be cold- blooded murder ! 
I demand that you hand me over to the police 
--------------------
--------------------
Criminals ? 
Are you proud of yourselves ? 
--------------------
--------------------
" have so far , unfortunately , failed to bear any fruit . 
" On the other hand the police face the almost impossible task 
--------------------
--------------------
Poor craftsmanship , boy ! 
They got the better of you . 
--------------------
--------------------
Bring me the case file of the Marga Perl murder . 
Thank you ! 
--------------------
--------------------
It seems he 's really trapped ! 
We 'd better call the cops right away . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no , not necessary . 
Thanks . 
--------------------
--------------------
The bastard has to go ! 
- But I can 't help it ! 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's ridiculous ! 
Do you mean to say this monster should go free ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- No , no . 
Yes ... 
--------------------
--------------------
You 've been through some really horrible things . 
I think it 's obvious that Anker really loves her . 
--------------------
--------------------
But I almost died . 
I was lucky . 
--------------------
--------------------
- You blamed it on him . 
He was the one who found her and saved her , too . 
--------------------
--------------------
- You don 't know shit . 
I know ... ... that you 'd better relax . 
--------------------
--------------------
You thought Anker killed your sister ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
You talked while Hanne was lying in the tub with her wrists cut ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
It made everything really difficult . 
I realized I couldn 't help Hanne during the wedding - 
--------------------
--------------------
You can 't know if they want to die . 
You don 't ask yourself when you need help , do you ? 
--------------------
--------------------

What would fools do without him , Christian ? 
He lends them his imagination , at an exorbitant rate of interest 
--------------------
--------------------
Since Potemkin lost an eye , he thinks I see badly 
If I win more of your money , I 'll need a second coach

You wanted to warn me , even though you despise me 
More than a deed of friendship

Count Cagliostro , you are under arrest ! 
My respects to Catherine the Great

No wonder my ancestors lost the battle of Kahlenberg 
It 's really better ?

Bad teeth ! 
Good teeth !

Sometimes with high interest

In your case , it 's very difficult , madam 
Some catty friends say I 'm twenty- seven days old 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm going to die , just when I 've settled down 
- The old Earth- dweller is dying - Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Others died ; he lived on 
He loved restlessness , so he didn 't want to age 
--------------------
--------------------
I don 't want to live on when you die 
I love you 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's a pity because it 's difficult for you to understand . 
You see , i love fred and he loves me . 
--------------------
--------------------
It makes everything difficult and dangerous . 
You know , i don 't think love makes people brave 
--------------------
--------------------
It was quite an accident . 
The princess couldn 't help it . 
--------------------
--------------------
Shut up , damn you ! 
It 's true !

Why can 't you open this door , you fool ?

Bloodthirsty savages from the wilds of America ! 
Ha ... ha ... ha ! 
--------------------
--------------------
They are only a trap to catch the pennies of fools . 
My life is consecrated to a great experiment . 
--------------------
--------------------
You cheated me . 
Your beauty was a lie . 
--------------------
--------------------
Boy , that’ s too bad . 
Good appetite to you and your quiet guests . 
--------------------
--------------------
Why are you always visiting that horrid old place ? 
[ laughing ] 
--------------------
--------------------
Stupid , incredibly stupid . 
Yes , sir . 
--------------------
--------------------
Yes , and another murder may be happening now . 
It’ s a confession you wish to make ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Bloodthirsty savages from the wilds of America ! 
Ha ... ha ... ha ! 
--------------------
--------------------
This gorilla killed six men , you see . 
What a funny- looking man .

Lina Dragon , the Robber KiIler ! 
Please , forgive us ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Are their brains completely rotten ? ! 
Hey , you know , meat tastes best just before it spoils . 
--------------------
--------------------
Shape and form are meaningless to me . 
Is there a shape you wish me to take ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Are you getting angry ? 
Oh , I love it ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Too bad , I 'II retreat for now . 
Do you need a hand ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Is he dead ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Weak . 
Can 't she be saved ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Is he dead ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Weak . 
Can 't she be saved ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Death is waiting ... 
... deliverance by the grace of our heavenly Lord . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's crazy , he 'll drown . 
A fine example of civic courage from a man of our class . 
--------------------
--------------------
I never saved anyone cos I never got the chance . 
- You need luck . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Am I dead ? 
- You 're very much alive . 
--------------------
--------------------
You were probably alone ; with no one to resort to . 
We 'll rally round in support . 
--------------------
--------------------
Me , ungrateful ? 
- Do you want me to kiss you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- You 're uglier than before . 
- Kiss me now . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't be stupid ; I want to talk to you . 
I smell nice , don 't l ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Bad boy ! 
I 'm not bad .

What 's wrong ? 
Answer me , darling . 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's been wrong the last eight days ? 
Do you flee your beloved ? 
--------------------
--------------------
A savage ! 
I don 't care one bit , wherever he may be . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's crazy , he 'll drown . 
A fine example of civic courage from a man of our class . 
--------------------
--------------------
I never saved anyone cos I never got the chance . 
- You need luck . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Am I dead ? 
- You 're very much alive . 
--------------------
--------------------
You were probably alone ; with no one to resort to . 
We 'll rally round in support . 
--------------------
--------------------
Me , ungrateful ? 
- Do you want me to kiss you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- You 're uglier than before . 
- Kiss me now . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't be stupid ; I want to talk to you . 
I smell nice , don 't I ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Bad boy ! 
I 'm not bad . 
--------------------

What 's wrong ? 
Answer me , darling .

--------------------
--------------------
You Iook so sad , miss . 
I 've good reason . 
--------------------
--------------------
- I wasn 't harming it . 
No , but you 'd better dust the piano . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 'II drown ! 
How wonderful ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- Ernest is dead ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
My asthma keeps me choked up quite enough . 
Yet you claim you were his friend . 
--------------------
--------------------
I was no Iess a friend for missing his funeral . 
I was a close friend , and he knew it . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're even uglier than before . 
I want a kiss ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I get bored aII alone in my room . 
I 'm not exactly jumping for joy in my room either . 
--------------------
--------------------
You Iook angry , Mr. Lestingois . 
Not with me , I hope . 
--------------------
--------------------
You have no shame ! 
- I won 't do it again . 
--------------------
--------------------
What 's wrong ? 
Answer me , darling . 
--------------------
--------------------
That savage ! 
Wherever he 's gone , I couldn 't care Iess .

I feel bad , very bad . 
Help me , please . 
--------------------
--------------------
- What an idiot ! 
Are you better ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Damn it , the police . 
You better return this . 
--------------------
--------------------
Is it you who was lying on the landing ? 
Yes , I order to monitor the house . 
--------------------
--------------------
Why is pretending to be deaf and dumb ? 
It feels more secure . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Hates Africa ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
- But what 's wrong with soap and water ? 
- Everything , darling . 
--------------------
--------------------
I thought I hated this country . 
Since you 're here I almost love it . 
--------------------
--------------------
They 'll stampede . 
That was friendly of someone . 
--------------------
--------------------
- That cry we heard from the river . 
- Yes , it must have been . 
--------------------
--------------------
That hurt me . 
Don 't be so funny . 
--------------------
--------------------
There 's something sad about retracing . 
You 've been very brave , Jane . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Hates Africa ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
- But what 's wrong with soap and water ? 
- Everything , darling . 
--------------------
--------------------
I thought I hated this country . 
Since you 're here I almost love it . 
--------------------
--------------------
Does that mean we lose the elephant tracks ? 
Yes , but with good luck we 'll pick them up on the other side . 
--------------------
--------------------
They 'll stampede . 
That was friendly of someone . 
--------------------
--------------------
- That cry we heard from the river .

--------------------
--------------------
But I couldn 't see him suffer 
He was consumed by his love for the sea 
--------------------
--------------------
You 've no right to stop him 
He can sail anywhere he likes , just so long as it isn 't on water 
--------------------
--------------------
Madness - exactly . 
I 'm glad he realizes at last 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't scold her . 
It 's passion , can 't you see ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You should be ashamed of yourself 
Fanny , darling 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry . 
I 'm better now 
--------------------
--------------------
Of course it 's a tragedy but you might have guessed 
When a girl has a lover , it 's to be expected . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's dishonest 
It 's not dishonest . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , it 's my fault . 
I must take the best I can out of it 
--------------------
--------------------
Believe me , no man ever acted more selfishly than I am acting now 
I couldn 't be happier ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- He 'd be a bastard 
That 's true 
--------------------
--------------------
There 's no harm in wondering 
That 's certainly true 
--------------------
--------------------
But I couldn 't see him suffer . 
He was consumed by his love for the sea . 
--------------------
--------------------
Madness - exactly . 
I 'm glad he realizes at last . 
--------------------
--------------------
" Don 't worry about me . 
I 'm happy as a clam . " 
--------------------
--------------------
They why didn 't you kill your first wife ? 
First , she never cheated on me . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't scold her . 
It 's passion , can 't you see ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You should be ashamed of yourself . 
Fanny , darling . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry . 
I 'm better now . 
--------------------

It 's not dishonest . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , it 's my fault . 
I must make the best I can of it . 
--------------------
--------------------
But don 't worry . 
Once her keel is in the air , she won 't budge . 
--------------------
--------------------
- He 'd be a bastard . 
That 's true . 
--------------------
--------------------
There 's no harm in wondering . 
That 's very true . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't get the wrong idea . 
They call me Taxi ... because I won 't ride in nothing else . 
--------------------
--------------------
You must be tired . 
Tell me , Ned , do you love me ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Helen , what 's wrong ? 
Do I love you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- It was such a bad picture . 
I thought it was pretty good . 
--------------------
--------------------
You ought to hear some of the suckers squawk . 
She takes them like Grant took Richmond . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm not going to stay in this dump anymore . 
I 'm going to find myself a better bed . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , it 's tragic to me . 
Wish I were necessary to your happiness . 
--------------------
--------------------
All this is fake . 
You care more about Johnny than anything else on Earth . 
--------------------

Fooling , huh ? 
" Come little girl , I want to take care of you . "

Now , don 't you worry about my brains . 
Well , that 's a help . 
--------------------
--------------------
I was gettin ' all the business on this block . 
Since you moved in , trade 's been pretty slow . 
--------------------

If there was any guy troubling you - 
More gallant still .

--------------------
So badly I was afraid you 'd break a leg . 
This sounds like something special .

Goodness , what beautiful diamonds . 
--------------------
--------------------
As I was saying , life is very sad . 
This is the first happy time I 've had since I was 27 . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , I got no quarrel with him . 
And I 'm sure you 're gonna be very happy .

I have made a terrible mistake . 
l 'd better look after me dog .

What 's wrong with them , Parson ? 
I imagine the honourable divine objects to their morals . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're very cruel . 
I reserve the privilege of choosing my friends . 
--------------------
--------------------
The government has offered 20, 000 for his capture alive or dead . 
It will be a great day for China when that price is paid . 
--------------------
--------------------
Everything else has become so unimportant . 
I don 't care if you were going to leave with him . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 'il never have any cause for regret . 
Please forgive me for my lack of faith . 
--------------------
--------------------
All right , since you 've taken all this trouble . 
It might be a good plan to get them out of the way . 
--------------------
--------------------
It makes me feel terrible to see you cry like that . 
Well , can 't a girl cry a little bit when she 's happy ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Have you been mooning around with that nonsense in your mind ? 
- Please don 't make fun of it . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 've never loved anybody else . 
We 've been sweethearts since we were kids . 
--------------------
--------------------
How ever you came to make that idiotic blunder is beyond me . 
- Well , after all , I have some pride . 
--------------------
--------------------
When it 's gone , you 'll lose him . 
Because then he 'll want love . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Oh , I 'm crazy with jealousy . 
You do love me . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Awful . 
But you know , it really is going to be charming .

- Bill , you 're jealous . 
I 'd like to see Mr. Gaerste , please . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no . 
That won 't do .

No sooner do I get out of town than you start cheating on me . 
- Bill , you 'd better take Irene home . 
--------------------
--------------------
Nothing but a lot of loneliness and humiliation . 
I could have made good here . 
--------------------

I got stomach trouble , too . 
Better get some sleep .

Yeah , and now he come to a dead stop . 
Here , you better smoke one of mine .

What do I care where he gets it ?

You better have a drink , Tony .

- Better get some sleep .

Yeah , and now he 's come to a dead stop . 
Here , you 'd better smoke one of mine .

- 1 never have fun . 
" Never have fun . " You call that fun ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- It 's gonna bring you trouble . 
- What do I care ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Afterwards , he no belong to me no more . 
He 's no good and now you start to be just like him .

- Yes ?

Why don 't you stop them from killing me instead ? 
I don 't want my soul saved .

--------------------
--------------------
You know , this jug broke when we dropped it . 
Good . 
--------------------
--------------------
But I don 't know danger . 
Oh , but it 's not only danger I want to take you away from . 
--------------------
--------------------
I should have died first . 
I can save her if you 'll tell me . 
--------------------
--------------------
At the grove ... by the Cestian Bridge in the temple ruins . 
Take care of that boy . 
--------------------
--------------------
And you have these enemies of Nero safely in prison . 
It 's true , isn 't it ? 
--------------------
--------------------
You 've never returned that love . 
You 've hardly been friendly . 
--------------------
--------------------
If that doesn 't do it , she 's dead . 
A love song , Ancaria ... with the pantomime . 
--------------------
--------------------
Drown them out ! 
A love song is stronger than a fanatical dirge . 
--------------------
--------------------
Your Christianity will be stamped out and dead within a year . 
I know better . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 'll lose . 
Mercy ! 
--------------------
--------------------
It was only your body that was weak , not you . 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
" If in the melancholy shades below 
" The flames of friends and lovers cease to glow 
--------------------
--------------------
Why , I never saw a man so distracted . 
I never saw a man with better reason to be . 
--------------------
--------------------
You mean , that I 'm wicked ? 
Well , yes , something like that . 
--------------------
--------------------
You know , this jug broke when we dropped it .

Six reasons why banks fail . 
I love your jokes , Matt . 
--------------------
--------------------
- You think I 'm lying ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm not interested in profits . 
I 'm interested in the bank . 
--------------------
--------------------
By making a lot of idiotic loans ? 
Take it easy , Clark . 
--------------------
--------------------
- What 's wrong with that kind of banking ? 
- Pure luck . 
--------------------
--------------------
I was afraid of making a fool of myself . 
But I won 't stand it any longer . 
--------------------
--------------------
Poor kid , you have been neglected , haven 't you ? 
I don 't care , darling . 
--------------------
--------------------
But you needn 't go on account of this idiot . 
You better carry that around with you all the time . 
--------------------
--------------------
- You are a poor man . 
I got it from the best authority . 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's the trouble nowadays . 
You don 't know who to trust . 
--------------------
--------------------
I don 't know what 's wrong . 
I wouldn 't trust anybody . 
--------------------
--------------------
Come on , don 't be a fool . 
Matt , you trust me , don 't you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
But I didn 't kill that man last night . 
Honest I didn 't . 
--------------------
--------------------
All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . 
But you 'll stand by me , won 't you , Mr Dickson ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I couldn 't do anything wrong . 
I love you too much , you know that . 
--------------------
--------------------
If he pulls a gag about the run , we 'll murder the guy . 
I suppose you guys had a good run for your money ...

--------------------
- Poor sap . 
Careful what you wish for . 
--------------------
--------------------
Dig away , bastards ! 
We don 't care ! 
--------------------
--------------------
These men are disgusting , Morache . 
Make sure they 're clean . 
--------------------
--------------------
They know we 're attacking . 
Get ready ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Killed defending a cemetery - that 's too much . 
They 'll bury us alive to save time . 
--------------------
--------------------
They 're attacking ! 
Help ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- We 're dead as it is . 
- It 's to see who 's not dead yet . 
--------------------
--------------------
Hear that attack ? 
Time to clear out ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Fat bastard . 
We 're safe here , with 12 feet of earth above us . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Poor sap . 
Careful what you wish for .

--------------------
I hate to do this . 
And I did so want to bring you luck . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm tired . 
Well , the fun will just have to go on without me . 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , no , no , no ! 
Wait , darling , till I get my mules . 
--------------------
--------------------
( CHUCKLlNG UNCOMFORTABLY ) 
Well , how do you like New York ? 
--------------------
--------------------
And I think these girls ' pictures are terrible . 
Didn 't I tell you she was clever ? 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's just a blind . 
There won 't be any publicity . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're wasting your time , Miss Everly . 
Happens I 'm in love with my husband . 
--------------------
--------------------
I hate to do this . 
And I did so want to bring you luck . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm tired . 
Well , the fun will just have to go on without me .

Oh , no , no , no !

You 're wasting your time , Miss Everly . 
Happens I 'm in love with my husband . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Yeah , no problem . 
- Good gracious ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- Oh , don 't be angry . 
Come on , let 's laugh it off . 
--------------------
--------------------
So you can just stop trying to make me nervous . 
Well , well , Mr. Zilch , how are you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- Otto , stop this foolishness . 
- Yes , sir . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Murdered ? 
But , Doctor , please , please . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't you recognize hysteria reaction when you see it ? 
- Otto , help him . 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , this is terrible ! 
Easy , now . 
--------------------
--------------------
Dr. Rowitz has met with an accident . 
- I wish you 'd go back to your room . 
--------------------
--------------------
- He is very tired . 
- That 's a good idea , Otto . 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , this is a terrible place . 
I wish I were away from it . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's very tired . 
He 's working under a terrific strain . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry . 
- Thank you , Dr. Wells . 
--------------------
--------------------
And the murderer is still here . 
I 'm convinced . 
--------------------
--------------------
Horrible ! 
Yes , look at it , a real hand . 
--------------------
--------------------
A saint in this hell . 
You 've won the lottery with him . 
--------------------
--------------------
It pains me to tell you this . 
Yes , I know , you 're throwing me out . 
--------------------
--------------------
And that 's bad for business ! 
I 'm here to do you a favour . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm sick and dying . 
I love you . 
--------------------
--------------------
And no one will bother you . 
Are you happy ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Poor girl ! 
Everything is ready ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Why would she die ? 
She 's such a good person 
--------------------
--------------------
She 's dead . 
Hipo , be strong ! 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's immoral . 
It 's just the medal ceremony now . 
--------------------
--------------------
You can see all the disgusting human things . 
I find it thrilling . 
--------------------
--------------------
Gentlemen , there 's no doubt 
Madam the Princess of Chabran wins the first prize in one voice . 
--------------------
--------------------
Damn . 
An old friend Loulou invited without telling me . 
--------------------
--------------------
Pierre , you 're heartless ! 
And I who went to see it every month , for pleasure . 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , no , no , no , Madam , before all else , a piece of advice ! 
A good piece of advice ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I forgot to ask if the smoke disturbs you ? 
So you don 't care that your wife is a flirt ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Of course it 's stupid of me to try to survive ! 
It 's perfectly justified , Madam . 
--------------------
--------------------
You wouldn 't be who you are if you weren 't suffering . 
It 's a small price to pay for our happiness . 
--------------------
--------------------
Not one of your words doesn 't cry : 
" I don 't love you anymore " . 
--------------------
--------------------
Are you mad ? 
That won 't do any good to your affairs . 
--------------------
--------------------
Worst panic ever known . 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Terrible ! 
Well , dear , I decided to come home for dinner after all . 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , so it 's your fault . 
Yes , sir ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , yes , you must be in awful pain . 
Oh , doesn 't look so good at that . 
--------------------
--------------------
Listen , do you mind beating it for a minute ? 
Well , he can 't move , dear . 
--------------------
--------------------
Look , Trouble , don 't change . 
If you get to know 50 beautiful women ... be this way , will you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I couldn 't bear to see you suffer . 
I 'll wade through the mud and love it . 
--------------------
--------------------
If you should lose it ... 
I hope I will be lucky enough to find it . 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , no , no . 
I want you to accept these as a token of our friendship . 
--------------------
--------------------
Now , Martin , watch the sound when Miss Sears screams . 
OK , chief . 
--------------------
--------------------
Why , the test was a terrible flop . 
They just laughed at it . 
--------------------
--------------------
Nonsense , you get right back into bed . 
You better look out . 
--------------------
--------------------
I might try beating you every morning before breakfast . 
That might prove effective . 
--------------------
--------------------
Poor little shaver . 
Just one more , darling , and then you 'll have to dress . 
--------------------
--------------------
Vivian , I 'm no puritan , and I 'm no killjoy . 
I don 't mind people having a good time . 
--------------------
--------------------
But you 're crying , Mommy . 
But I 'm happy , darling . 
--------------------
--------------------
Nonsense , you get right back into bed . 
You better look out . 
--------------------
--------------------
I might try beating you every morning before breakfast . 
That might prove effective . 
--------------------
--------------------
Poor little shaver . 
Just one more , darling , and then you 'll have to dress . 
--------------------
--------------------
Vivian , I 'm no puritan , and I 'm no killjoy . 
I don 't mind people having a good time . 
--------------------
--------------------
But you 're crying , Mommy . 
But I 'm happy , darling . 
--------------------
--------------------
over a poor little horse . 
All ready , Your Honor 
--------------------
--------------------
The man your father framed and sent to prison . 
Yes , dear , he 's your father . 
--------------------
--------------------
with rustlers , renegades and bad men . 
Pleasure , Miss Malloy . 
--------------------
--------------------
- You know Fu Manchu ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
You always dreamt of this dead raider . 
Carnarvon made his dream come true . 
--------------------
--------------------
Sheila , did you ever hear of a Dr. Fu Manchu ? 
Yes , I 've heard Father speak of him to the men . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Oh , no , no , Sheila . 
- I know he won 't do that . 
--------------------
--------------------
- You 're Fu Manchu ? 
- Please sit down so that we can enjoy your visit . 
--------------------
--------------------
- It was a fake ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
You changed them the night McLeod was killed . 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Do you want to destroy us all ? 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Our war eagles scream . 
The splendor of the world is yours . 
--------------------
--------------------
You think the boy is especially lazy ? 
Yes , that 's what I think . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't blame the morn that brings hardship and work . 
It 's wonderful to care for those one loves . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's too dirty there . 
I 'm not going to ruin my life . 
--------------------
--------------------
Nonsense . 
I want my freedom . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's too dirty there . 
I 'm not going to ruin my life . 
--------------------
--------------------
Nonsense 
I want my freedom 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's too dirty there . 
I 'm not going to ruin my life . 
--------------------
--------------------
Nonsense 
I want my freedom 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's in a horrible fix , that 's why he keeps on playing this . 
He 's a hard case on hand ... 
--------------------
--------------------
A bomb ! 
One feels much safer here than in my bed . 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's Your Majesty 's ancestor , Queen Elizabeth the Terrible . 
Thank God it 's only a piece of her . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Don 't worry . 
I am always OK . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Now he 's insulted me ! 
I won 't tolerate that ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You are found guilty . 
I advise you to accept the sentence . 
--------------------
--------------------
You always get me into trouble . 
Yes , you do . 
--------------------
--------------------
That might disturb him . 
- He 'd be glad ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- That guy is so greedy ! 
- It 's good ... 
--------------------
--------------------
And poor Anton had to die . 
Such a pride of the family ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Why did you kill Goldberg ? 
I am not a murderer . 
--------------------
--------------------
He makes 2000 francs a month with his horrible designs . 
Was your family rich ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- You 're behaving badly . 
- Very true . 
--------------------
--------------------
She 's dead . 
- Take care of her . 
--------------------
--------------------
Not bad , eh ? 
Yes , he 's here . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm very unhappy , Inspector . 
Who can I trust ... 
--------------------
--------------------
I 've been poisoned . 
Help me . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't let me die ... 
Try to relax . 
--------------------
--------------------
Or maybe they can smell trouble . 
They 're good at that . 
--------------------
--------------------
" Repent for your sins , ye children of darkness . " 
Let me save you . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 'll make him hate you worse than ever . 
I don 't care . 
--------------------
--------------------
She hardly left her bed the whole time she was ill . 
Well , ladies , let 's combine business with pleasure . 
--------------------
--------------------
I remember Miss Jenny warning you the day you bought it . 
It simply won 't stand the wear and tear . 
--------------------
--------------------
No trouble at all . 
The world 's bright for the first time in three years . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm ashamed of you . 
That 's no way for a great big man to act . 
--------------------
--------------------
You don 't have to worry . 
I 'll give his party special attention . 
--------------------
--------------------
The cowardly criminal comes to barter and to trade . 
To trade the liberty of his associate for his own . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm a little disappointed . 
I expected to meet a lot of interesting people and talk to them . 
--------------------
--------------------
He is a good reporter , but a very terrible tap dancer . 
That 's funny . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm fighting a losing battle . 
You 've won . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry , Joan . 
I 'll take care of everything in the house . 
--------------------
--------------------
Depressed ? 
It 's true . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm a fool . 
But , Joan , you and Jerry are gonna be so happy . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry about her . 
I can take care of her , all right . 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't you worry . 
I won 't even let him out of my sight . 
--------------------
--------------------
Very bad . 
You should have complete rest and relaxation . 
--------------------
--------------------
I can 't neglect my guests , you know ? 
Buck didn 't give us time to say good evening . 
--------------------
--------------------
I only know that if she dies , well , I 'll kill you . 
If she dies , you won 't have to . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's a vile influence , too . 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Perhaps you failed to deduct the government tax . 
Yes , there 's a two cent tax on every check you write . 
--------------------
--------------------
She said you could go to the devil . 
Well , that 's nice of her . 
--------------------
--------------------
It would have been a shame for you to have missed it . 
I 'd begun to think you weren 't coming to the party . 
--------------------
--------------------
Mother hates for me not to . 
What a wise mother . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's no fool . 
Enjoy your ride ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I 've caused you enough embarrassment already . 
You 're very kind . 
--------------------
--------------------
Except that you got fired from the bank on account of him . 
Why did you lie to me if it wasn 't true ? 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's a vile influence , too . 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Perhaps you failed to deduct the government tax . 
Yes , there 's a two cent tax on every check you write . 
--------------------
--------------------

--------------------
--------------------
Mother hates for me not to . 
What a wise mother . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's no fool . 
Enjoy your ride ? 
--------------------
--------------------
In spite of the pigtails . 
But now you know better , don 't you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I 've caused you enough embarrassment already . 
You 're very kind . 
--------------------
--------------------
Except that you got fired from the bank on account of him . 
Why did you lie to me if it wasn 't true ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Saves time and trouble to get them at the same place . 
- Yes , I guess it does . 
--------------------
--------------------
He looks grouchy . 
- Powerful cider , ain 't it ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Nobody is mad at anybody . 
Everybody loves everybody . 
--------------------
--------------------
They 're bad enough when you got everything that money can buy . 
But you haven 't the comforts ... 
--------------------
--------------------
Elk 's Crossing is a dull little town , Eddie . 
And I 'm as smart now as I ever will be . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're wrong , Ed . 
I 've been very happy there . 
--------------------
--------------------
Saves time and trouble to get them at the same place . 
Yes , I guess it does . 
--------------------
--------------------
He looks grouchy . 
Powerful cider , ain 't it , Tom ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Nobody is mad at anybody . 
Everybody loves everybody . 
--------------------
--------------------
They 're bad enough when you got everything that money can buy . 
But you haven 't the comforts ... 
--------------------
--------------------
Elk 's Crossing is a dull little town , Eddie . 
And I 'm as smart now as I ever will be . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're wrong , Ed . 
I 've been very happy there . 
--------------------
--------------------
It 's terribly expensive here , Heinrich . 
But it 's wonderful . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Last night was not so good . 
- I thought she was splendid . 
--------------------
--------------------
I could not live happily otherwise . 
Yes , I know . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Unfortunately , no . 
- Will Mr. Kringelein kindly sign here ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I had it in the war . 
Besides , she 's rather pretty . 
--------------------
--------------------
No rest , no stopping . 
I was little , slim , but hard as a diamond . 
--------------------
--------------------
- I am away , sick . 
- That 's very interesting . 
--------------------
--------------------
No fighting . 
Save that for the office . 
--------------------
--------------------
You are annoying . 
- You don 't like to see me enjoying myself . 
--------------------
--------------------
- That 's terrible ! 
- He was a nice fellow . 
--------------------
--------------------
Too bad about the Baron . 
You always felt better when he came along . 
--------------------
--------------------
Lying there , with his eyes so open . 
You loved the Baron , didn 't you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I’ m ill , Flaemmchen . 
I won 't live long . 
--------------------

That 's nonsense ! 
We 'll find a great doctor .

It 's terribly expensive here , Heinrich . 
But it 's wonderful . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Last night was not so good . 
- I thought she was splendid . 
--------------------
--------------------
I could not live happily otherwise . 
Yes , I know . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Unfortunately , no . 
- Will Mr. Kringelein kindly sign here ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Poor kid . 
- I wish I were free tonight . 
--------------------
--------------------
I’ ve never been so tired in my life . 
Not even the Veronal can help me to sleep . 
--------------------
--------------------
I had it in the war . 
Besides , she 's rather pretty . 
--------------------
--------------------
No rest , no stopping . 
I was little , slim , but hard as a diamond . 
--------------------
--------------------
- I am away , sick . 
- That 's very interesting . 
--------------------
--------------------
No fighting . 
Save that for the office . 
--------------------
--------------------
You are annoying . 
- You don 't like to see me enjoying myself . 
--------------------
--------------------
- Life is wonderful , but it 's very dangerous . 
If you have the courage to live it , it 's marvelous . 
--------------------
--------------------
The big manufacturer Preysing killed Baron von Geigern . 
Good heavens ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- That 's terrible ! 
- He was a nice fellow . 
--------------------
--------------------
Too bad about the Baron . 
You always felt better when he came along . 
--------------------
--------------------
Lying there , with his eyes so open . 
You loved the Baron , didn 't you ? 
--------------------
--------------------
I’ m ill , Flaemmchen . 
I won 't live long .

Well , in that case , I intend to kill you . 
We were friends . 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm really quite upset . 
I do appreciate the courtesy . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no , no . 
Nothing nearly as grand , Lieutenant . 
--------------------
--------------------
Poor Bertie did . 
Well , I 'll tell you , that 's a relief to hear . 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's a long time to hang around after you just killed a man . 
Yes , a logical question . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no . 
I 'd be delighted . 
--------------------
--------------------
There 's a suicide clause in the policy . 
If I can ever be of any help ... 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm terribly sorry . 
I enjoyed it . 
--------------------
--------------------
I owe it to myself to express my dissatisfaction . 
I was clearly in line for the position that you gave George . 
--------------------
--------------------
I have been betrayed , pursued , and threatened by innuendo . 
The least I could hope for is some understanding from my wife . 
--------------------
--------------------
My problem is just the opposite . 
Born smart , as they say . 
--------------------
--------------------
Now the killer knows when the record will end . 
Yes , yes , you 've demonstrated all that . 
--------------------
--------------------
We can go directly to the more difficult questions . 
Ah , yes , here we are . 
--------------------
--------------------
Boquerón has fallen ! 
A glorious , torn Paraguayan flag flutters over the fort walls . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no . 
- Yes , yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Here , on your heart I don 't suffer anymore . 
How beautiful you are , more than ever this evening , Mariù ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Today I am with you , why be sad ? 
Speak to me of love , Mariù ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Here in your arms I suffer no more , 
Speak to me of love , Mariù ! 
--------------------
--------------------
- Don 't worry . 
Good night . 
--------------------

" Do you love China ? "

BROKEN LULLABY 
This is a day of joy and happiness for all of us . 
--------------------
--------------------
For no reason , for no reason at all 
And he didn 't even raise a hand to defend himself 
--------------------
--------------------
And she forgave the murderers . 
And God will help you , my boy . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no , Father , I 'm going to his country ! 
Yes , yes ... 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no , don 't do it , don 't do it , Fritz . 
Hold yourself in , and save it up for a real Frenchman . 
--------------------
--------------------
Doctor Holderlin , I 'm afraid I have to disappoint you . 
I 'm not a sick man . 
--------------------
--------------------
War is over , life must go on . 
To make a long story short , I wish to marry Elsa . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no , no . 
Wonderful day . 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , no , no ! 
It was inspiration as it only had been given to you by God . 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's what 's wrong with us . 
Always trusting , believing anybody . 
--------------------
--------------------
I think badly of you . 
Be a good girl , please stay in that room with your grandmother . 
--------------------
--------------------
Failed ? 
I think you 'd better go back tonight . 
--------------------
--------------------
Kill him ! 
Open unto us the door of thy loving- kindness 
--------------------
--------------------
Kill him ! 
Hit the sympathy seeker ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Kill him ! 
The sympathy seeker !

Fyodor Mikhailovich , do you remember " Crime and punishment " ? 
That book is outstanding ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I 'm tired of this life . 
In memory of my dad , help me . 
--------------------
--------------------
Poor soul , he 's waiting for a reply since 6 months ! 
But I 'm waiting since three years , dear ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You took the fur , and Ralph died at the hospital ... 
Do you mean that he has got time to be happy ? ... 
--------------------
--------------------
I get to carry the bag , and I scare out the hares . 
- So , do you like it here ? 
--------------------
--------------------
- A worm isn 't dirty . 
You won 't find anything cleaner in the world . 
--------------------
--------------------
That 's my son you 're calling a dirty brat . 
I don 't care if he is your son . 
--------------------
--------------------
Mme Lepic will be furious . 
In her heart , she 'll be happy . 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , it 's terrible ! 
To speak to me like that ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You 'll never be happier than today . 
It 's not as if your mother doesn 't love you . 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're going to kill yourself ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
- To kill himself . 
- Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
Carrot- top has gone to kill himself . 
Half an hour ago , we were chatting like old friends , 
--------------------
--------------------
As unhappy as me ? 
If that makes you happy . 
--------------------
--------------------
She 's not happy when she 's hitting me ? 
Yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
How unfortunate ! 
But now get up , darling . 
--------------------
--------------------
No no no no no ! 
Yes yes yes yes 
--------------------
--------------------
Unhappy ? 
Not yet enough success ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Women have broken this man . 
They stole his poetry and faith ... and then they dropped him . 
--------------------
--------------------
He 's lonely , and he 's suffering . 
Cheers . 
--------------------
--------------------
A swollen nose . no no 
- You 're not ugly . 
--------------------
--------------------
Then I 'll die with you . 
What if I fell in love with another man , Peterle ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Those damned doctors ! 
I was perfectly healthy . 
--------------------
--------------------
Through my own wife they poison me ! 
But Peterle , I 'm not poisoning you ! 
--------------------
--------------------
No no 
I won 't put up with it ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Why does she look so terrible ? 
Because of the excitement . 
--------------------
--------------------
May the devil take him ! 
hallo yes , it 's I why are you in ... what ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Are you dead now ? 
yes . 
--------------------
--------------------
I am very tired , Peterle . 
Good night ! - 
--------------------
--------------------
Why do you make such a sad face ? 
You 'll arrive here for your pleasure ! 
--------------------
--------------------
I have just taken them by mistake ! 
Please , please ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Don 't worry ! 
I won 't do anything to you ! 
--------------------
--------------------
But no scandal ! 
- So , is everything ready ? 
--------------------
--------------------
No false inhibitions ! 
It won 't harm the hotel direction , and it will help you ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Is it that bad ? 
Yes ! 
--------------------
--------------------
You shouldn 't be burdened by anything ! 
You need a young man ... a nice home ... 
--------------------
--------------------
By the way , your efforts are useless ! 
The little girl is neither " Countess " nor rich ! 
--------------------
--------------------
Police , Criminals ... 
Yes , yes ... 
--------------------
--------------------
You 're arrested . 
You think that 's so easy ? 
--------------------
--------------------
Because I hate him . 
Because I love you . 
--------------------
--------------------
No , no , I 'm sorry . 
Good- bye . 
--------------------
--------------------
Oh , that 's terrible . 
Isn 't that wonderful ?

Good night .
